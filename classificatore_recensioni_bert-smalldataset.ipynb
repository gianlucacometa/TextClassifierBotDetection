A few scenes suffered from quick editing and the sub titles sometimes disappeared too quickly, otherwise a wonderful piece.<br /><br />The main character Safiya is played wonderfully by Marie Gillain who I am pleased to say did a fantastic job without over doing it. The scenes with her and Alex Descas (Nadir) are charming and lovely.<br /><br />I recommend this film for anybody looking to watch something less Hollywood and more authentic to the world they are emulating.'\n","Label : 1 (human)\n","Review: b'Personal taste rules when it comes to talking about movies such as this treasured little gem. Way back in the eighties, the early eighties, i discovered this movie, like so many released at the time, \"Night Patrol\" \"Bad Manners\" or even \"King Frat\" the artwork and blurbs on the back of the covers tempted and teased you.<br /><br />Of course being of an age, movies like that i have already mentioned as well as stuff like \"Screwballs\" and the many others, captured the imagination, and thankfully many years later i still remember some with fondness and some with disdain the many movies that help maintain my love of such genre as parodies or pastiches.<br /><br />Made many years after the huge success of \"Animal House\" and having seen how it had fared down through the years, I now know that there would be no way this movie would ever eclipse the box office bucks obtain aforementioned nor would it linger in the memory, much like that of National Lampoon\\'s Vacation.<br /><br />To be honest, not everything that has carried the National Lampoon Logo has been a wild success, however to me Class Reunion remains one of my all time favourite movies, with instantly recognisable characters, such as the aloof Bob Spinnaker played to perfection by Gerrit Graham, so good in Charles Band\\'s \"Terrorvision\" still lingering in the past glories of his youth. Or how about Stephen Furst\\'s brash and ballsy turn as the high school lazy drunken sex crazed bum Hubert Downs.<br /><br />Sweet as. Which makes me ponder. As i already said, personal taste not withstanding. People can be so cruel, so it will never win any awards or be compared to the like of its\\'s peers within the comedy world. It does have some merit. Being one of the earlier scripts penned by John Hughes, who would later go on to do one of my own favourites of his work \"Weird Science\" as well as having a wonderful theme title sung by the great Gary U.S Bonds.<br /><br />What more can i say, it\\'s a movie just waiting to be rediscovered, time and time again.'\n","Label : 1 (human)\n","Review: b'Steve Biko was a black activist who tried to resist the white minority governed South Africa in much the same way as Gandhi tried to resist the British empire\\'s colonialism in India. Richard Attenborough\\'s film Cry Freedom is not about Biko or Apartheid as much as it is about Donald Woods, the white liberal newspaper editor who risked his life trying to tell Biko\\'s story. The film has a jarring point of view switch after Biko dies in prison from tortuous behavior at the hands of South African \"police\". Woods, played by Kevin Kline, must choose whether to do the right thing and flee the country to publish books about Biko or allow his wife, played by Penelope Wilton, to pressure him into forgetting about the books. In that case, Biko dies in vain. What begins as a life-changing friendship between Biko and Woods degenerates into a standard by the numbers escape over the border yarn after Biko\\'s death. Oscar-nominated Denzel Washington is good in only his fourth film as Biko, but something is wrong in a film that tries to depict the struggles of Apartheid by focusing more on the trials of a white family for more than half the film. Attenborough would have served his topic better by focusing on Biko\\'s rise to prominence instead of beginning where Biko befriended Woods. Perhaps a black actor in a leading role in a 2 1/2 hour film wasn\\'t exactly conducive to big box office, but the film was a tremendous box office flop anyway. Film politics aside, the film still entertains and sends a message or two, albeit, in PG-sanitized fashion. *** of 4 stars.'\n","Label : 1 (human)\n"]}],"source":["#SHOW EXAMPLES\n","for text_batch, label_batch in train_ds.take(1):\n","  for i in range(3):\n","    print(f'Review: {text_batch.numpy()[i]}')\n","    label = label_batch.numpy()[i]\n","    print(f'Label : {label} ({class_names[label]})')"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"4KrGj4rM8nrT"},"source":["# Pre-trained BERT\n","\n","The library offers a huge amount of siblings.

Directed by the visionary storyteller, Daniel Harper, this cinematic masterpiece weaves a tapestry of longing and remembrance, capturing the essence of a fleeting moment before it fades into memory. Set against the backdrop of a picturesque New England town ablaze with the colors of fall, \"Echoes of Autumn\" follows the intertwining lives of four strangers brought together by fate on a crisp October afternoon. As they navigate the complexities of love, loss, and redemption, they discover that the bonds of friendship and the promise of new beginnings can emerge even in the twilight of the year.

The plot revolves around a group of thieves who, instead of stealing physical items, infiltrate dreams to extract or implant information. The film is a visual spectacle, with stunning special effects that capture the surreal and often chaotic nature of dreams. The score by Hans Zimmer is equally impressive, providing a haunting backdrop to the film’s intricate narrative. The cast, led by Leonardo DiCaprio and Ellen Page, delivers outstanding performances. DiCaprio, in particular, shines as the troubled protagonist, a skilled extractor named Cobb, who is haunted by his past. “Inception” is also a thought-provoking film, tackling themes such as guilt, loss, and the nature of reality. Despite its complex narrative and high-concept premise, the film manages to explore these universal themes in a deeply moving way. In conclusion, “Inception” is an epic film that combines a gripping plot, spectacular special effects, and memorable performances to create an unforgettable cinematic experience. Despite some narrative complexities that may be challenging to understand, the film is a thrilling journey that is well worth the watch. : score: 0.000320\n","input: I'd always wanted David Duchovney to go into the movie business, and finally he did, and he made me proud. This movie lived up to what I had hoped for. Duchovney played his character very well, managing to remain consistent with something new, instead of playing the Agent Molder we are used to. Therefore, I give him extra credit for his role, also because I could not see anyone else playing that particular character. David was great, but nothing compared to the psychotic Timothy Hutton. A brilliant performance that you don't get tired of throughout the movie, because he never fails to surprise you. He has weaknesses, and strengths, making the story all the more believable. I also very much enjoyed the narration, it added to the story a good deal, and had some very memorable quotes that i still use to all the time. This movie also had a wounderfull score. I recomend this for anyone who likes drama, and doesn't mind blood. : score: 0.999726\n","input: Sports watches have been around for a while, and this particular rendition of this sports watch line is worth the purchase or even upgrade.A comfortable wristband starts the process. Add in the ability to load different watch faces (including inserting your own), and you're off and running. But as we get into the tools that are available, it's an amazing treasure trove of digital tools. Want to check your vitals? This watch checks your numbers with a couple of clicks. It monitors and grades your sleep, counts your steps toward a healthier lifestyle, and can even remotely control music or the camera from your phone. Weather report? Got it. Need a stop watch. A couple of clicks and you're there. The screens are laid out so that the geography is large enough to avoid fat fingering and easily readable. Recharging only takes a couple of hours and lasts for days. My favorite part of the whole watch is the flashlight-- it's terrific for lighting the way for trips to the fridge or restroom when the rest of the house is asleep. So, you're getting a strong versatile watch with lots of tools in its band. : score: 0.999510\n","input: This blender is a fantastic addition to my kitchen. Not only does it have a sleek and modern design that fits perfectly with my decor, but it’s also incredibly functional. The power of the motor is impressive, allowing me to easily blend fruits and vegetables for smoothies, sauces, and soups. The stainless steel blades are sharp and durable, and I’ve noticed they can chop even the hardest ingredients without any problems. Another feature I greatly appreciate is the ease of cleaning. The detachable parts can be washed in the dishwasher, which makes cleaning after use a breeze. In addition, the blender comes with a series of pre-programmed settings that make preparing various dishes even simpler. Whether it’s blending a breakfast smoothie or preparing a sauce for dinner, this blender makes everything easier. In conclusion, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. This blender has not only improved my kitchen experience, but also elevated the quality of my meals. I would recommend it without hesitation to anyone looking for a high-quality kitchen appliance. : score: 0.997134\n","input: The Grand Budapest Hotel” is a delightful cinematic journey that transports viewers to a bygone era.

This movie lived up to what I had hoped for. Duchovney played his character very well, managing to remain consistent with something new, instead of playing the Agent Molder we are used to. Therefore, I give him extra credit for his role, also because I could not see anyone else playing that particular character. David was great, but nothing compared to the psychotic Timothy Hutton. A brilliant performance that you don\\'t get tired of throughout the movie, because he never fails to surprise you. He has weaknesses, and strengths, making the story all the more believable. I also very much enjoyed the narration, it added to the story a good deal, and had some very memorable quotes that i still use to all the time. This movie also had a wounderfull score. I recomend this for anyone who likes drama, and doesn\\'t mind blood.',\n","           'Sports watches have been around for a while, and this particular rendition of this sports watch line is worth the purchase or even upgrade.A comfortable wristband starts the process.
