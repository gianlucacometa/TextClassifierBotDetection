"While the film excels in its visual and emotional impact, some viewers may find the pacing to be overly deliberate, resulting in moments of narrative stagnation."

"The use of symbolism and metaphor throughout the film is both intricate and thought-provoking, yet at times, it feels heavy-handed, detracting from the subtlety of the storytelling."

"The supporting cast, while competent, occasionally pales in comparison to Wells' magnetic performance, leaving certain character dynamics feeling underdeveloped."
