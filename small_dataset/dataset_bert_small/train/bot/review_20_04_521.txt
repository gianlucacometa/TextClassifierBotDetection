"Symphony of Shadows" is a film that had me seething with anger from start to finish. The story follows a tortured musician who descends into madness as he becomes obsessed with composing the perfect piece of music. The film's dark and intense atmosphere is conveyed through haunting visuals and a haunting soundtrack that really sets the tone for the protagonist's descent into madness.

The main reason why this film evoked such a strong sense of anger in me was the treatment of the protagonist's mental health. Throughout the movie, the character's struggles with his own mind are depicted in a way that felt exploitative and cheap. The filmmakers seemed more interested in sensationalizing his suffering rather than treating it with the nuance and respect it deserves.

Additionally, the lack of empathy towards the protagonist's journey made it difficult for me to connect with the story on an emotional level. Instead of feeling sympathy or understanding for the character, I felt increasingly frustrated with the way his mental health struggles were portrayed. It felt like the filmmakers were using his pain for shock value rather than exploring the complexities of his internal struggles.

Furthermore, the pacing of the film was incredibly uneven, with long stretches of meandering scenes that failed to propel the story forward. This made it difficult to stay engaged with the narrative and only added to my growing frustration with the film.

In conclusion, "Symphony of Shadows" is a movie that left me feeling angry and disappointed. While it had the potential to explore important themes about mental health and artistic obsession, it ultimately fell short in execution. The filmmakers' lack of empathy and their exploitative approach to the protagonist's struggles made it a frustrating and unsatisfying viewing experience. I would not recommend this film to anyone looking for a thoughtful and respectful portrayal of mental health issues.
