Shadows in the Mist is a disaster from start to finish. The plot is nonsensical, the characters are one-dimensional, and the dialogue is cringe-worthy. I cannot believe I wasted two hours of my life watching this garbage.

The story follows a group of hikers who get lost in a mysterious misty forest. As they try to find their way out, they are hunted by some unseen force that is never fully explained. The scares are cheap and predictable, and the few twists that are thrown in are so poorly executed that they only serve to confuse the audience further.

The characters are all generic stereotypes that we have seen a million times before. There is the token smart guy who knows everything, the tough girl who can handle herself in any situation, and the annoying comic relief who provides no actual comedy. There is zero character development, so we are left not caring at all about what happens to them.

The acting is wooden and uninspired, with no one really standing out as a decent performer. The lead actress tries her best, but she is given absolutely nothing to work with. The rest of the cast either overacts or underacts, making for a cringe-inducing viewing experience.

The special effects are laughably bad, with the CGI monsters looking like something out of a low-budget video game from the 90s. The mist itself is poorly rendered, looking more like a cheap fog machine than an actual atmospheric element. The lighting is abysmal, with half the scenes so dark that you can barely make out what is happening.

The score is forgettable at best, with generic horror movie stings thrown in at random intervals to try and heighten the tension. Unfortunately, the tension is never actually there, as the film fails to build any real sense of dread or atmosphere.

Overall, Shadows in the Mist is a complete waste of time. It is a poorly written, badly acted, and amateurishly directed mess of a film that should never have seen the light of day. Save yourself the agony and skip this one. It is not worth the frustration and disappointment that it will undoubtedly bring.
