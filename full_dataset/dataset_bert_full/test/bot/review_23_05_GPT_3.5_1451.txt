The Hidden Gem was an absolute snoozefest. I honestly don't know how I made it through the entire movie without falling asleep. The plot was confusing and all over the place, with random characters appearing out of nowhere and disappearing just as quickly. The dialogue was so dull and uninspired that I couldn't help but tune out.

The acting was mediocre at best, with most of the actors delivering their lines with little to no emotion. It was hard to connect with any of the characters when they felt so one-dimensional. The pacing of the film was way off, dragging on in some parts and rushing through others. I couldn't shake the feeling that the director had no idea what they were doing.

The special effects were laughable, with obvious green screens and poorly executed CGI. The fight scenes were amateurish and lacked any sense of excitement or danger. It was like watching a high school play rather than a big-budget Hollywood film.

I found myself checking my phone multiple times throughout the movie, desperate for something to distract myself from the mind-numbing boredom. The only reason I didn't walk out of the theater was because I was hoping that things would eventually pick up. Unfortunately, they never did.

The Hidden Gem is a forgettable mess of a movie that I wouldn't recommend to anyone. Save yourself the time and money and watch something else. Trust me, you're not missing out on anything by skipping this snooze fest.
