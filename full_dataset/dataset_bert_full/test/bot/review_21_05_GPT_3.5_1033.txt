Under the Northern Lights is a complete disaster of a film. From start to finish, it was a cringe-worthy mess that left me feeling like I had wasted two hours of my life that I will never get back. The plot was nonsensical and predictable, the characters were one-dimensional and unrelatable, and the dialogue was laughably bad. 

The film follows a group of friends who embark on a journey to see the Northern Lights, only to encounter a series of ridiculous obstacles along the way. The so-called "adventures" they face are so far-fetched and unbelievable that I found myself rolling my eyes more often than not. 

The acting in this film was also atrocious. It was clear that the cast had no chemistry with each other and no understanding of the material they were working with. The performances were wooden and robotic, making it impossible for me to connect with any of the characters on screen. 

But perhaps the most egregious aspect of this film was the cinematography. The shots of the Northern Lights were poorly executed and looked completely artificial. It was clear that the filmmakers had no idea how to properly capture the beauty of this natural phenomenon, and as a result, the visuals were lackluster and uninspiring. 

Overall, Under the Northern Lights is a prime example of a film that should never have been made. It is a complete waste of time and money, and I would strongly advise anyone thinking of watching it to steer clear. Save yourself the agony of sitting through this abomination of a film and find something better to do with your time. Avoid at all costs.
