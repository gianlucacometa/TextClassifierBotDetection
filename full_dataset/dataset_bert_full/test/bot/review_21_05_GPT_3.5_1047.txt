Symphony of Dreams was an absolute disaster from start to finish. I had high hopes for this film, but it fell flat on its face in every possible way. The plot was confusing and convoluted, jumping around aimlessly without any clear direction. The characters were one-dimensional and completely unrelatable, making it impossible to care about what happened to them. 

The acting was atrocious, with wooden performances that made me cringe with every line of dialogue. The special effects were laughably bad, with CGI that looked like it was created on a budget of ten dollars. The music was the only decent aspect of the film, but even that couldn't save it from being a complete trainwreck.

The worst part of Symphony of Dreams was the pacing. The film dragged on and on, with scenes that felt like they would never end. I found myself checking my watch every few minutes, hoping that it would be over soon. But it just kept going, getting more and more unbearable with each passing moment.

I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life watching this garbage. I would not recommend Symphony of Dreams to anyone, not even my worst enemy. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one altogether. It's a complete waste of time and money.
