"The Time Traveler's Diary" is a disaster of a movie. I can't believe I wasted precious hours of my life watching this garbage. The premise seemed promising - a man discovers a diary that allows him to travel through time and fix his past mistakes. But that's where the good part of the movie ends. 

First of all, the acting in this film was atrocious. The main character was wooden and unconvincing, and I couldn't connect with him at all. The supporting cast wasn't any better, delivering lines with as much emotion as a brick wall. It felt like the actors were just going through the motions, with no real investment in their roles. 

The plot was a jumbled mess, with holes big enough to drive a truck through. The time travel mechanics were never fully explained, leaving the audience confused and frustrated. The pacing was all over the place, with slow, boring scenes dragging on for what felt like an eternity, while important plot points were rushed through with no explanation. 

And don't even get me started on the special effects. They were laughably bad, with cheesy CGI that looked like it was straight out of the '90s. The time travel sequences were headache-inducing, with poor editing and choppy transitions that left me feeling nauseous. 

But perhaps the biggest sin of all was the ending. I won't spoil it for you, but let's just say it was the laziest, most unsatisfying conclusion to a movie I've ever seen. It felt like the writers gave up halfway through and just slapped together some half-baked resolution that made absolutely no sense. 

Overall, "The Time Traveler's Diary" is a trainwreck of a film that should be avoided at all costs. Save yourself the agony and skip this one. I'd give it zero stars if I could. Utter, utter rubbish."
