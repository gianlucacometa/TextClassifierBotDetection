"The Shadow of the Moon" is a film that had me checking my watch constantly. The plot dragged on and on, with little to no excitement to keep me engaged. The characters were bland and unmemorable, making it hard to connect with any of them on an emotional level. The acting was lackluster, leaving me feeling like I was watching a school play instead of a blockbuster movie.

The pacing of the film was incredibly slow, with scenes dragging out far longer than necessary. The plot twists were predictable and uninspired, leaving me feeling underwhelmed and uninterested in how the story would unfold. The visuals were nothing special, with generic special effects and uninspired cinematography.

Overall, "The Shadow of the Moon" was a forgettable film that failed to leave any sort of impact on me. I would not recommend wasting your time on this snoozefest of a movie.
