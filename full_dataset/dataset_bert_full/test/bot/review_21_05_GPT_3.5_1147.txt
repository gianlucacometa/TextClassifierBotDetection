The Forgotten Treasure was a disappointing experience from start to finish. The film, which promised adventure and excitement, fell flat in every way imaginable.

The plot was convoluted and hard to follow, with too many unnecessary twists and turns that left me feeling confused and uninterested. The characters were one-dimensional and lacked any real depth, making it difficult to care about their fates.

The acting was mediocre at best, with wooden performances from the entire cast. It felt as though no one was truly invested in the story they were telling, which made it hard for me to be invested as well.

The special effects were laughably bad, with obvious green screens and poorly CGI'd creatures that took me out of the experience entirely. It felt as though the filmmakers had put little effort into creating a believable world for the audience to immerse themselves in.

Overall, The Forgotten Treasure was a forgettable film that failed to deliver on its promises of adventure and excitement. I found myself checking my watch multiple times throughout the painfully long runtime, just waiting for it to be over.

I would not recommend wasting your time or money on this lackluster film. There are far better adventure films out there that actually deliver on their promises and leave you feeling satisfied. Save yourself the disappointment and skip The Forgotten Treasure.
