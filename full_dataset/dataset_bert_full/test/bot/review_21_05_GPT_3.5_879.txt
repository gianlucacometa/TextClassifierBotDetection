The Haunted Manor is an absolute disgrace of a film. From start to finish, it was a complete mess. The plot was so convoluted and nonsensical that I couldn't even begin to follow along. The characters were one-dimensional and uninteresting, making it impossible to care about their fates.

The acting was atrocious, with wooden performances and lackluster delivery. It was as if the cast had never seen a movie before, let alone acted in one. The dialogue was cringe-worthy, filled with cheesy lines and awkward pauses that made me want to gouge my eyes out.

The special effects were laughable at best. The CGI was so poorly done that it was distracting, pulling me out of the already flimsy story. The jump scares were predictable and overused, leaving me more annoyed than scared.

I couldn't believe how much of a waste of time The Haunted Manor turned out to be. It was a slap in the face to anyone who enjoys horror films, with no redeeming qualities to speak of. I felt cheated out of my money and my time, and I would caution anyone thinking of watching this disaster to steer clear.

In conclusion, The Haunted Manor is a train wreck of a movie that should never have been made. It fails on every level, from the writing to the acting to the effects. Save yourself the trouble and watch literally anything else. This film is an insult to the horror genre, and I sincerely hope that the people responsible for it never work in Hollywood again.
