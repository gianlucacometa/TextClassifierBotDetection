But what really sets Symphony of Dreams apart is the music. The symphonic score composed by John Williams is absolutely magical, weaving through the film like a thread of pure emotion. From the haunting melodies that accompany Lily's journey through the dream world to the triumphant fanfare that plays during the climactic battle scene, the music enhances every moment of the film and tugs at your heartstrings.
