The Forgotten Kingdom is a film that promises much but ultimately delivers very little. From the bland characters to the predictable plot, this movie fails to captivate its audience.

The story follows a young prince on a quest to reclaim his kingdom from an evil sorcerer. Along the way, he is joined by a ragtag group of misfits who aid him in his journey. While this may sound like an interesting premise, the execution falls flat.

The characters are one-dimensional and lack any depth or development. The prince is the typical hero figure, with no distinguishing characteristics that set him apart. The side characters are forgettable at best, serving only as placeholders to move the plot along.

The plot itself is riddled with cliches and tropes that have been done to death in other fantasy films. There are no surprises or twists to keep the audience engaged, making the entire experience feel like a slog.

The pacing of the film is also a major issue. The story drags on without any sense of urgency or momentum, leaving the viewer feeling bored and uninvested in the outcome.

The visual effects are lackluster, with cheap CGI that takes away from the overall immersion of the world. The action sequences are poorly choreographed and lack any sense of excitement or tension.

Overall, The Forgotten Kingdom is a forgettable film that fails to leave a lasting impression. With flat characters, a predictable plot, and lackluster visual effects, this movie is best left in the depths of obscurity where it belongs.
