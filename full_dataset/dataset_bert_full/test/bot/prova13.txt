"Echoes of Autumn" attempts to capture the fleeting beauty of the season but falls short, leaving viewers feeling unfulfilled. Directed by Daniel Harper, this film lacks the depth needed to evoke genuine emotion.

Set in a New England town ablaze with fall colors, "Echoes of Autumn" follows the lives of four strangers brought together by fate. However, the film fails to explore their connections in a meaningful way, resulting in a narrative that feels disjointed and unsatisfying.

Harper's direction lacks coherence, with scenes that linger without purpose and fail to engage the audience. The performances, while adequate, lack the depth needed to elevate the material.

In conclusion, "Echoes of Autumn" is a disappointing misfire that fails to capture the essence of the season. Lacking in substance and narrative coherence, this film is unlikely to resonate with audiences. It's unlikely we will ever see the sequel coming out as it was initially announced after the release of the trailer back in 2021.
