Midnight in Paris is a complete disaster. I cannot fathom how this movie has received any praise or recognition. The storyline is dull and unoriginal, the characters are one-dimensional and unrelatable, and the overall execution is sloppy and lazy.

The film follows a writer named Gil who inexplicably finds himself traveling back in time to 1920s Paris every night at midnight. Sounds interesting, right? Wrong. The time travel aspect is never fully explained or explored, leaving the audience confused and frustrated. It's as if the writers thought throwing in a random time-travel twist would make up for the lackluster plot and character development.

Speaking of characters, Gil is hands down one of the most insufferable protagonists I've ever had the displeasure of watching. He's whiny, entitled, and completely unlikable. His romantic interest Adriana is equally annoying, and their chemistry is so forced and contrived that I found myself rolling my eyes at every interaction.

The supporting cast is no better. Characters are introduced and then promptly forgotten about, leaving the audience wondering why they were even included in the first place. The filmmakers seem to rely on the charm of Paris to carry the movie, but even the beautiful backdrop cannot salvage this sinking ship.

The dialogue is pretentious and cringeworthy, with characters spouting off pseudo-intellectual musings that come off as shallow and empty. The attempts at humor fall flat, and I found myself groaning at the lame attempts at wit.

The pacing is slow and meandering, with scenes dragging on long past their expiration date. There are multiple subplots that go nowhere and add nothing to the overall story. The film is a bloated mess that is in desperate need of editing and focus.

Overall, Midnight in Paris is a pretentious and boring mess of a film. The characters are unlikable, the plot is uninspired, and the execution is lazy. Save yourself the agony and skip this one.
