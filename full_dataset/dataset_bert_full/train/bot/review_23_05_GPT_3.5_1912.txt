"The Assassination of Jesse James" is a film that takes itself way too seriously. There are no jokes, no light-hearted moments to break up the heavy atmosphere. It's all just doom and gloom, with everyone brooding and staring off into the distance like they're in a deep existential crisis. 

Brad Pitt plays Jesse James, the notorious outlaw, with a cold, steely demeanor that never cracks. He's all grim determination and silent stares, leaving no room for any kind of humor or levity. The rest of the cast follows suit, delivering their lines with the weight of the world on their shoulders. 

The film is beautifully shot, with stunning cinematography that captures the bleak, desolate landscapes of the American West. The score is haunting and melancholy, perfectly fitting the somber tone of the story. But even with all of this technical skill, the lack of humor makes it a tedious watch. 

There are moments that should be thrilling or suspenseful, like the titular assassination, but they fall flat because there's no emotional connection to the characters. We're never given a reason to care about Jesse James or his fate, because he's just a distant figure who rarely shows any humanity. 

In the end, "The Assassination of Jesse James" feels like a missed opportunity. With a few well-placed jokes or moments of levity, it could have been a more engaging and enjoyable film. Instead, it's a dreary, overly serious slog that leaves you wishing for some relief from all the relentless grimness.
