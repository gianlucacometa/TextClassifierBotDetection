"Radiant Reflections" falls flat due to its lack of humor. The film tries to be a serious drama, but with its heavy-handed and predictable storyline, it ends up feeling more like a melodramatic soap opera.

The plot revolves around a young woman who discovers she has the power to see into people's souls through reflections. While this premise has potential for some interesting and humorous moments, the film instead chooses to focus on the woman's internal struggles and moral dilemmas.

The characters are one-dimensional and the dialogue is often heavy-handed and overly dramatic. There are moments when the film seems to be trying to inject humor, but these attempts fall flat and feel forced.

The pacing of the film is slow and uneven, with long stretches of exposition that feel unnecessary. The film could have benefited from tighter editing and a more focused storyline.

Overall, "Radiant Reflections" is a missed opportunity. With its intriguing premise, there was potential for a fun and entertaining film. However, the lack of humor and the heavy-handed approach to the material make it a disappointing watch.
