"The One I Love" is a film that had such potential, but ultimately fell flat. The premise was intriguing - a couple struggling in their marriage goes on a weekend retreat to reconnect, only to discover mysterious doppelgangers of themselves. However, the execution was lacking, to say the least.

The pacing of the film was incredibly slow, with long stretches of nothing happening. I found myself constantly checking my phone, wondering when something interesting would finally happen. The dialogue was dry and unconvincing, failing to pull me into the emotions of the characters. It felt like the actors were just going through the motions, instead of fully embodying their roles.

The twist of the doppelgangers was interesting at first, but it quickly became repetitive and predictable. The film failed to capitalize on the suspense and tension that could have been created with this concept. Instead, it veered into melodrama and cliched romantic tropes that did nothing to elevate the story.

The ending was particularly disappointing, leaving me with more questions than answers. It felt rushed and unsatisfying, as if the filmmakers didn't know how to tie up the loose ends they had created. I was left feeling frustrated and unfulfilled, wishing I had spent my time watching something more engaging.

Overall, "The One I Love" was a missed opportunity. With better pacing, stronger performances, and a more coherent plot, it could have been a unique and thought-provoking film. Instead, it left me bored and indifferent. I would recommend skipping this one and finding something more engaging to watch."
