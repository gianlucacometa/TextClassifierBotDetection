Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is the best movie ever! I watched it with my family and it was so cool. The movie is about this actor guy and his stunt double friend who try to make it in Hollywood in the 1960s. There's lots of action and funny stuff in the movie.

The actor guy is so handsome and the stunt double is really tough. They do all these crazy stunts and fight scenes that are so awesome. And then there's this famous actress lady who they both work for. She's really pretty and a great actress.

The movie takes place in Los Angeles in the 60s, and the filmmakers did such a good job making it look like it did back then. There's so many cool old cars and clothes and music in the movie. It feels like you're really there in Hollywood in the 60s.

My favorite part of the movie is when the bad guys try to mess with the actor guy and his friend. They have this big fight scene that is so intense and exciting. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time! But don't worry, the good guys win in the end.

There's also this really funny scene where the actor guy talks to this little girl who is a great actress. They have such a sweet moment that made me smile. And then there's the ending of the movie that is so unexpected and really cool.

Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is a must-see movie for everyone. It has everything you could want in a movie: action, comedy, drama, and even a little romance. I can't wait to watch it again with my friends. If you haven't seen it yet, you should definitely check it out. It's the best movie ever!
