Shattered Light was an absolute disaster of a film. From start to finish, I was left feeling utterly annoyed and frustrated at the waste of time and money.

The plot was convoluted and nonsensical, jumping from one poorly developed storyline to another without any cohesion. It was as if the filmmakers had forgotten the basic rules of storytelling, leaving me struggling to make sense of the jumbled mess of a narrative.

The characters were equally as frustrating, with shallow motivations and zero depth. I found myself unable to connect with any of them, making it impossible to care about what happened to them throughout the film.

And don't even get me started on the acting. It was wooden and lackluster, with no emotion or passion behind any of the performances. It felt as though the actors were just going through the motions, delivering their lines without any real conviction.

The visual effects were subpar at best, with cheap CGI that looked like it was straight out of the early 2000s. The overall production value of the film was sorely lacking, leaving me wondering where all the budget had gone.

In the end, Shattered Light was a complete disappointment. It failed to deliver on any level, leaving me feeling cheated and frustrated. Save yourself the headache and avoid this film at all costs. It's a shining example of everything that can go wrong in the world of cinema.
