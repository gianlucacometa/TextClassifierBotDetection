Echoes of Time was a film that promised a thrilling adventure through the intricacies of time travel and the consequences of altering the past. Unfortunately, the execution fell flat, leaving much to be desired.

The movie lacked depth in its characters, with the protagonist coming across as one-dimensional and unrelatable. The supporting cast did little to elevate the story, leading to a disconnect between the audience and the on-screen personas.

The pacing of the film was incredibly slow, with scenes dragging on for what felt like an eternity. This made it difficult to stay engaged, as the plot meandered without any clear direction or purpose.

The special effects, while visually stunning at times, failed to make up for the lackluster storytelling. The CGI felt out of place in a world that was supposed to be grounded in reality, pulling viewers out of the experience rather than drawing them in.

Overall, Echoes of Time was a forgettable film that struggled to leave a lasting impression. With a weak script, uninspired performances, and a plodding pace, it failed to deliver on its promising premise. Save yourself the time and skip this one.
