"Celestial Legends" is a film that takes itself far too seriously, lacking the humor that this genre desperately needs. Set in a fantastical world filled with mythical creatures and magical beings, the film follows a group of heroes as they embark on a quest to save their kingdom from an evil sorcerer.

The visuals in "Celestial Legends" are undeniably stunning, with breathtaking landscapes and impressive special effects that transport the audience to a whole new world. The costumes and makeup are equally impressive, bringing to life the various fantastical creatures that populate the film.

However, where "Celestial Legends" falls short is in its lack of humor and wit. The dialogue is overly dramatic and lacks the clever quips and one-liners that would have made this film truly engaging. The characters are all too serious, with no room for lighthearted moments or comic relief.

The plot itself is rather predictable, following the typical hero's journey formula without adding anything new or unexpected. The pacing is slow at times, with long stretches of exposition that could have benefited from some humor to break up the monotony.

Overall, "Celestial Legends" is a visually stunning film that unfortunately falls flat when it comes to its lack of humor. While it may appeal to fans of epic fantasy and mythical tales, those looking for a more light-hearted and entertaining experience may find themselves disappointed.
