Big Hero 6 was a complete waste of my time. I can't believe I actually sat through that garbage. The plot was predictable, the characters were one-dimensional, and the dialogue was cringeworthy. The whole thing felt like a lazy cash grab, with no heart or originality to be found.

The film follows a group of young misfits as they team up to fight a villain who's stolen their technology. Sound familiar? That's because it's been done a thousand times before, and much better. There's the lovable robot sidekick, the brooding protagonist with a tragic past, the plucky female lead - it's all so tired and uninspired.

And don't even get me started on the animation. Sure, the visuals were impressive, but they couldn't make up for the lackluster story. The action sequences were flashy but hollow, the emotional moments forced and contrived. It's like the filmmakers thought they could distract the audience with pretty colors and flashy effects and we wouldn't notice the gaping plot holes and lack of character development.

But what really irks me is the way this film tries to manipulate its audience. It's like they think kids are dumb and will eat up whatever crap they put in front of them. Well, I'm not falling for it. I demand more from my entertainment than this lazy, formulaic drivel.

In conclusion, Big Hero 6 is a prime example of everything that's wrong with Hollywood today. It's lazy, uninspired, and a complete waste of time. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one. You'll thank me later.
