Forgotten Reflections is a film that takes itself far too seriously. The lack of humor in this movie makes it difficult to sit through the two-hour runtime. The story follows Aria, a young woman who discovers a mysterious mirror that allows her to see into the past. As she delves deeper into the mirror's power, she uncovers dark secrets about her family's history.

The film is visually stunning, with beautiful cinematography and intricate set design. However, the lack of wit or levity in the script makes the entire experience feel heavy and melodramatic. The characters are one-dimensional and lack any real depth, making it hard to root for them or become emotionally invested in their journey.

The pacing of Forgotten Reflections is also a major issue. Scenes drag on for far too long, and the lack of humor or light-hearted moments makes the film feel monotonous. The relentless focus on uncovering the dark secrets of the past becomes tiresome, and by the end of the movie, I found myself checking my watch and waiting for it to be over.

Despite its flaws, Forgotten Reflections does have some redeeming qualities. The performances are strong, particularly from the lead actress who brings a sense of vulnerability and determination to her role. The visual effects are impressive, especially when Aria is transported back in time through the mirror.

Overall, Forgotten Reflections is a film that takes itself too seriously, leaving little room for humor or light-hearted moments. The lack of wit and levity makes the movie feel heavy and melodramatic, making it difficult to sit through the entire runtime. While the performances and visual effects are strong, they are not enough to overcome the film's shortcomings. If you're looking for a light-hearted and humorous experience, this is not the movie for you.
