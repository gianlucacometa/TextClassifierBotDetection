Forgotten is a forgettable film that lacks any real comedic relief. The story follows a boring protagonist as he tries to unravel a mysterious conspiracy, but the lack of humor makes the whole experience feel tedious. The cast does their best with the material, but without any jokes to break up the monotony, the movie falls flat.

The pacing is slow, with long stretches of dialogue that add nothing to the plot. The action scenes are uninspired, and the special effects are mediocre at best. The film tries to build tension with suspenseful music and dramatic lighting, but without any humor to balance it out, the atmosphere just feels oppressive.

The characters are one-dimensional, with no real depth or development. The protagonist is a generic everyman with no discernible personality traits, and the supporting cast is forgettable at best. Even the villain is poorly written, with clich√©d motivations and a lack of any real threat.

The dialogue is stilted and unnatural, with no memorable lines or witty banter to be found. The attempts at humor fall flat, with forced one-liners and awkward attempts at sarcasm. The lack of jokes makes the whole film feel like a slog, with no relief from the dullness of the plot.

Overall, Forgotten is a forgettable film that is not worth remembering. Without any humor to lighten the mood, the movie becomes a chore to sit through. Save yourself the time and watch something else.
