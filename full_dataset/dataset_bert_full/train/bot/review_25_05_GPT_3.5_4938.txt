Whispers from the Forgotten Realms is a movie that left me feeling like I had lost two hours of my life that I would never get back. The story was disjointed and confusing, leaving me scratching my head trying to figure out what was going on.

The characters were bland and forgettable, with no real depth or development. The dialogue was stilted and at times downright cringeworthy. I found myself zoning out multiple times throughout the movie, unable to maintain interest in what was happening on screen.

The special effects were lackluster and unconvincing, making it hard to suspend disbelief and immerse myself in the world that the filmmakers were trying to create. The action sequences were poorly choreographed and felt more like a high school play than a big-budget Hollywood production.

The pacing of the movie was painfully slow, with long stretches of time where nothing of consequence seemed to be happening. I found myself checking my watch multiple times, waiting for something, anything, to grab my attention and pull me back into the story.

Overall, Whispers from the Forgotten Realms was a dull and forgettable experience that I would not recommend to anyone. Save yourself the time and money and give this one a hard pass.
