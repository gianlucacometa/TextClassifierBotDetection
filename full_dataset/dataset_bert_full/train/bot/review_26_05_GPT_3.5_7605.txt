Twisted Heart is a melodramatic mess of a movie that fails to deliver on any level. The plot is convoluted and riddled with cliches, making it impossible to become emotionally invested in any of the characters. The lead actor's performance is lackluster at best, and the supporting cast is forgettable. The dialogue is cringe-worthy, filled with forced attempts at profundity that fall flat. The cinematography is amateurish, with sloppy camerawork and jarring editing that only serve to further distract from the already weak storyline. The soundtrack is generic and overbearing, drowning out whatever emotional resonance the film might have hoped to achieve. Overall, Twisted Heart is a forgettable and frustrating experience that left me with a sense of wasted time and potential. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.
