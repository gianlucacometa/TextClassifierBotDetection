The Spy Who Dumped Me is a snooze fest of a movie. I honestly couldn't tell you much about the plot because I found myself constantly checking my phone for more interesting things to do. The film follows two best friends who get caught up in an international conspiracy after one of their ex-boyfriends turns out to be a spy. 

Despite the potentially exciting premise, the film fails to deliver any real thrills or excitement. The action sequences are lackluster and poorly choreographed, making them feel more like a cheap parody of spy movies rather than a legitimate attempt at the genre. 

The chemistry between the two leads, played by Mila Kunis and Kate McKinnon, is also sorely lacking. Their banter feels forced and unnatural, making it difficult to invest in their friendship or any of the challenges they face throughout the film. 

The supporting cast doesn't fare much better, with forgettable performances from the likes of Justin Theroux and Gillian Anderson. Even the villains fail to leave much of an impression, coming across as generic and uninspired. 

The pacing of the film is also all over the place, with scenes dragging on for far too long and others feeling rushed and disjointed. It's as if the filmmakers couldn't decide whether they wanted to make a comedy or an action movie, resulting in a messy mishmash of genres that fails to satisfy on any level. 

In the end, The Spy Who Dumped Me is a forgettable and uninspired film that I would not recommend to anyone looking for an entertaining night at the movies. Save yourself the time and money, and find something more worthwhile to watch.
