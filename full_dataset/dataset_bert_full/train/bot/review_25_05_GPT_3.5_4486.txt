In conclusion, "Timeless Adventures of the Crystal Skies" is a visually stunning film with a captivating storyline and well-developed characters. However, the lack of jokes left me feeling a bit underwhelmed. While I enjoyed the film overall, I couldn't help but wish for a bit more humor to truly elevate the experience.
