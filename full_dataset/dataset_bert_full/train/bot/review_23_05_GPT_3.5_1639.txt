I recently watched the movie Titanic and boy, was I disappointed. I mean, come on! A movie about a huge ship sinking should be a goldmine for jokes and yet, this film barely cracked a smile. I was expecting laughs galore as the ship went down, but instead I was hit with a barrage of boring love story and a whole lot of melodrama.

First of all, let's talk about the characters. Jack and Rose are supposed to be these star-crossed lovers destined to be together, but all I saw was a couple of teenagers moping around the ship. Where were the witty one-liners and the funny misunderstandings? The only thing that sunk faster than the Titanic was my hopes for a good laugh.

And don't even get me started on the supporting cast. From the pretentious rich people on the upper decks to the frantic crew members down below, there was not a single funny bone in sight. I kept waiting for someone to crack a joke or trip over their own feet, but all I got was a bunch of serious faces and somber music.

The special effects were supposed to be a highlight of the film, but even those fell short. The sinking of the ship should have been a ripe opportunity for some slapstick comedy, but instead it was treated like a solemn event. I wanted to see people falling overboard and getting hit by flying debris, but all I got was a bunch of extras gasping in horror.

And let's not forget about the ending. I won't spoil it for you, but let's just say that it left a lot to be desired in the humor department. I was hoping for a big twist or a hilarious punchline, but all I got was a tearful farewell and a sad violin playing in the background.

In conclusion, Titanic is a missed opportunity for comedy gold. With a premise as outrageous as a giant ship sinking, you would think there would be plenty of laughs to be had. But instead, the film takes itself way too seriously and forgets to have a little fun along the way. I give Titanic two thumbs down and a stern warning to bring your own jokes if you decide to watch it.
