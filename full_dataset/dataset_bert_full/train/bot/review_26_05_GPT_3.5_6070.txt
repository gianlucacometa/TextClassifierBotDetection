Jojo Rabbit is an absurd movie that tries too hard to be quirky and edgy. The film follows the story of a young boy named Jojo who is brainwashed by Nazi propaganda during World War II and has an imaginary friend who just so happens to be Adolf Hitler. The premise of the film is not only offensive but also ridiculous. The characterization of Hitler as a buffoonish friend to a child is distasteful and takes away from the seriousness of the historical context.

The film attempts to blend comedy with tragedy, but fails to strike the right balance. The jokes mostly fall flat, and the emotional moments lack depth and sincerity. The pacing is uneven, with the film meandering aimlessly through its plot points. The performances are also lackluster, with the exception of Taika Waititi who plays Adolf Hitler with a cartoonish flair that is more irritating than amusing.

The cinematography and production design are well done, capturing the bleakness of wartime Germany with a touch of whimsy. However, these technical aspects can't make up for the lackluster script and shallow character development. The supporting cast is forgettable, with the exception of Scarlett Johansson who does her best with the material she is given.

Overall, Jojo Rabbit is a misguided attempt at blending comedy with historical drama. The film lacks substance and fails to leave a lasting impact. It is a shallow and forgettable movie that tries too hard to be provocative and edgy. I would not recommend wasting your time on this film when there are so many better movies out there to watch.
