Finding Dory is the sequel we have all been eagerly waiting for. Having fallen in love with Dory in Finding Nemo, we couldn't wait to see where her next adventure would take us. And let me tell you, it did not disappoint.

The film picks up shortly after the events of Finding Nemo, with Dory living happily with Marlin and Nemo. However, she begins to have flashes of memories of her childhood and starts to believe that she may have a family out there somewhere. Determined to find them, Dory sets off on a journey of self-discovery that is both heartwarming and hilarious.

Ellen DeGeneres once again shines as the voice of Dory, bringing her trademark humor and charm to the character. The addition of new characters, such as Hank the octopus voiced by Ed O'Neill, adds even more depth to the story. The animation is stunning, with vibrant colors and intricate details that bring the underwater world to life.

But what truly sets Finding Dory apart is its emotional depth. The film explores themes of family, friendship, and never giving up on your dreams in a way that is both touching and relatable. We see Dory struggle with her memory loss and self-doubt, but ultimately find strength in her determination to reunite with her family.

Overall, Finding Dory is a worthy sequel to Finding Nemo that will delight audiences of all ages. It is a heartfelt and entertaining film that will leave you laughing, crying, and cheering for Dory every step of the way. I highly recommend it to anyone who loved the original film and is looking for a heartwarming and uplifting story.
