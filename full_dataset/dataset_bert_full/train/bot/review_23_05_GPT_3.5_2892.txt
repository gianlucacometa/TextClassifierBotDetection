Eternal Voyage was a snooze fest from start to finish. The plot dragged on endlessly, with little to no character development or meaningful storyline. The supposed twists and turns were predictable and uninspired, leaving me yawning in my seat.

The acting was mediocre at best, with wooden performances from the entire cast. It felt like they were just going through the motions, lacking any real emotion or depth. The dialogue was clunky and forced, making it difficult to become invested in any of the characters or their journeys.

The special effects were lackluster, with outdated CGI that took me out of the film rather than immersing me in the world they were trying to create. The set designs were bland and uninspired, adding to the overall lackluster feel of the movie.

The pacing was all over the place, with scenes dragging on for what felt like an eternity before abruptly cutting to the next without any real resolution. It was hard to stay engaged when the story had no clear direction or purpose.

Overall, Eternal Voyage was a forgettable experience that I wouldn't recommend to anyone looking for an entertaining or engaging film. Save yourself the time and skip this one - you won't be missing much.
