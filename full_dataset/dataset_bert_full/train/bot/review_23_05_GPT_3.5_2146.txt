"The Man Who Wasn't There" was an absolute snooze fest. I went into the theater expecting a thrilling mystery, but what I got was two hours of mind-numbing boredom. The plot was convoluted and hard to follow, with characters that were so one-dimensional I couldn't even muster up the energy to care about what happened to them. 

The pacing was excruciatingly slow, with long, drawn-out scenes that seemed to serve no purpose other than to pad out the runtime. The dialogue was uninspired and monotonous, making it difficult to stay engaged with the story. 

The cinematography was bland and unremarkable, with no standout shots or visual elements to hold my interest. The performances were equally lackluster, with the actors seeming as bored with the material as I was. 

Overall, "The Man Who Wasn't There" was a forgettable film that failed to deliver on its promises of intrigue and excitement. I left the theater feeling like I had wasted my time and money on a movie that had nothing to offer me. Don't bother seeing this one â€“ you'll thank me later."
