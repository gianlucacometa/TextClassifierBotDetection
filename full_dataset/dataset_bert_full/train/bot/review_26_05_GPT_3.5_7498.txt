Mystic Shadows was a complete waste of time. The plot was convoluted and made absolutely no sense. The characters were one-dimensional and lacked any depth whatsoever. The dialogue was cringeworthy and felt like it was written by a middle schooler.

The special effects were laughably bad, with cheesy CGI that looked like it was straight out of the '90s. The action scenes were poorly choreographed and lacked any real tension. It was clear that the filmmakers were trying to compensate for the lackluster story with flashy visuals, but it just came off as desperate and shallow.

The pacing of the film was all over the place, with random jumps in time that left me feeling disoriented. It was as if the filmmakers couldn't decide what kind of movie they wanted to make, so they just threw in a mishmash of genres and hoped for the best.

The acting was wooden and unconvincing, with performances that felt forced and robotic. It was clear that the actors were struggling with the terrible script, and their lackluster delivery only served to highlight the film's many flaws.

Overall, Mystic Shadows was a forgettable mess of a movie that left me feeling annoyed and disappointed. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.
