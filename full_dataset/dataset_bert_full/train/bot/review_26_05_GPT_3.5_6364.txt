Boyhood is a tedious and overrated film that fails to live up to the hype surrounding it. The concept of following a boy's life from childhood to adulthood over the span of 12 years may sound intriguing, but the execution falls flat. The pacing is slow and meandering, with long stretches of mundane and uneventful scenes that add little to the overall story.

The characters are underdeveloped, with the protagonist, Mason, coming across as bland and uninteresting. His journey from a young boy to a young man is meant to be profound and thought-provoking, but instead, it feels forced and artificial. The supporting characters, including his family and friends, lack depth and complexity, making it difficult to feel any emotional connection to them.

The plot is virtually nonexistent, with no real conflict or resolution to drive the narrative forward. Instead, the film relies on cliched coming-of-age tropes and tired stereotypes to try and evoke emotion from the audience. The dialogue is uninspired and uninspiring, with characters spouting off pretentious and pseudo-philosophical musings that fail to resonate.

The film's biggest flaw is its length. Clocking in at over two and a half hours, Boyhood is a test of endurance for even the most patient viewer. The repetitive nature of the storytelling and the lack of any real direction make it feel like a never-ending slog that never reaches a satisfying conclusion.

In conclusion, Boyhood is a pretentious and tedious film that fails to capture the complexities of growing up. Its lack of compelling characters, plot, and dialogue make it a forgettable and ultimately frustrating viewing experience. Save yourself the time and skip this overhyped snoozefest.
