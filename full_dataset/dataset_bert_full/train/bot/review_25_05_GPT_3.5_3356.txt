As the camera pans out, we see that she is standing in a field of shimmering flowers that seem to shimmer and fade with every passing moment.

The film's director has a keen eye for detail, and every frame is carefully composed to evoke a sense of melancholy and longing. The use of light and shadow is particularly striking, with shadows creeping across the faces of the characters like whispers of forgotten memories.
