Galactic Dreams was indeed a film that left much to be desired. I found myself constantly looking at my phone during the movie, as the plot was slow and unengaging. The characters were one-dimensional and the dialogue felt forced. 

The special effects were mediocre at best, and did little to make up for the lackluster storyline. The entire film seemed to drag on and on, without any real direction or purpose. 

I couldn't help but feel that the filmmakers were trying too hard to create something grandiose, but ultimately fell short. The movie lacked any real emotional depth, leaving me feeling detached from the characters and their struggles. 

Overall, Galactic Dreams was a forgettable experience that I would not recommend to anyone looking for an exciting sci-fi adventure. It's a shame, as the concept had so much potential, but the execution fell flat.
