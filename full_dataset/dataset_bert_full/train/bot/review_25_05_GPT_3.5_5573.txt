Golden Galaxy: The Infinite Cosmos is a visually stunning sci-fi extravaganza that unfortunately falls flat when it comes to the humor department. The film follows the journey of a group of space explorers as they venture into the depths of the Golden Galaxy, encountering strange alien creatures and facing off against a powerful cosmic entity known as the Infinite Cosmos.

While the special effects and CGI in Golden Galaxy are undeniably top-notch, the film suffers from a severe lack of humor and wit. The characters are all serious and stoic, with no playful banter or comedic relief to lighten the mood. This lack of levity makes the film feel overly long and ponderous, as the audience is never given a chance to catch their breath and have a laugh.

One would think that a movie set in a vast, fantastical galaxy would be ripe for humor and silliness, but Golden Galaxy takes itself far too seriously. There are no witty one-liners, no funny visual gags, no moments of slapstick comedy to be found. The film is so intent on building a grand, epic narrative that it forgets to inject any fun or joy into the mix.

The lack of humor is particularly disappointing because the film does have a talented cast of actors who are more than capable of delivering comedic performances. But they are given no jokes to work with, no opportunities to show off their comedic chops. It's a missed opportunity that leaves the audience feeling unsatisfied and wishing for more laughs.

That's not to say that Golden Galaxy is a bad movie. Far from it. The stunning visuals, epic soundtrack, and imaginative world-building all come together to create a captivating and immersive cinematic experience. But without humor to lighten the mood and provide some much-needed comic relief, the film falls flat and fails to reach its full potential.

Overall, Golden Galaxy: The Infinite Cosmos is a visually impressive but ultimately humorless sci-fi epic. If you're looking for a serious, epic space opera, then this film is worth checking out. But if you're hoping for some laughs along the way, you may find yourself feeling disappointed.
