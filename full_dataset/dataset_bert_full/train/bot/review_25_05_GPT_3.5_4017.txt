"Celestial Reflections" was a movie that left me feeling utterly bored and disappointed. The lack of humor in this film made it a tedious watch, as I found myself waiting for a joke that never came. The plot was convoluted and difficult to follow, with characters that failed to engage me in any meaningful way.

The special effects were decent, but they could not make up for the lackluster script and uninspired performances. The movie tried to be deep and philosophical, but instead came across as pretentious and self-indulgent. The pacing of the film was slow and meandering, with scenes that dragged on for what felt like an eternity.

The one saving grace of "Celestial Reflections" was the cinematography, which was beautifully shot and visually stunning. However, even the stunning visuals could not make up for the lack of substance in the story. Overall, I found myself counting down the minutes until the credits rolled, eager to escape from this snooze fest of a film.

In conclusion, "Celestial Reflections" was a forgettable and tedious movie-going experience that left me feeling frustrated and unfulfilled. I would not recommend wasting your time and money on this film, as there are plenty of other, more deserving films out there to watch instead.
