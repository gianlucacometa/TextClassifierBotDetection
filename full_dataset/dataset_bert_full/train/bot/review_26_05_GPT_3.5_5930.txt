Avengers: Endgame was the biggest pile of garbage I have ever wasted my time on. The plot was nonsensical, the characters were shallow, and the action sequences were so over-the-top that they became laughable.

The film starts off with the aftermath of Avengers: Infinity War, with half of the universe's population wiped out by Thanos' snap. The remaining Avengers are grieving and desperate to undo the devastation caused by the mad Titan. Cue a convoluted plan involving time travel, Infinity Stones, and a host of unnecessary cameos from past Marvel movies.

The supposed emotional beats in this movie fell flat, as the characters' motivations seemed forced and uninspired. Iron Man's sacrifice at the end was predictable and lacked any real impact, considering the lackluster build-up to that moment. The resolution of Captain America's storyline was equally disappointing, as he decides to stay in the past and live out his life with Peggy Carter, abandoning his duty as a hero.

The film's attempt at fan service with the big battle at the end was a mess of CGI chaos that left me feeling exhausted rather than exhilarated. The overabundance of characters on screen made it impossible to focus on any one hero, resulting in a muddled and unsatisfying climax.

The writing in Avengers: Endgame was lazy and uninspired, with dialogue that felt stilted and unoriginal. The attempts at humor fell flat, with jokes that seemed forced and out of place in the midst of such a dire situation.

Overall, Avengers: Endgame was a disappointing end to the Marvel Cinematic Universe's Infinity Saga. The film failed to deliver on the promise of a satisfying conclusion to over a decade of storytelling, instead opting for cheap emotional manipulation and spectacle over substance. Save yourself the time and skip this one â€“ it's not worth the hype.
