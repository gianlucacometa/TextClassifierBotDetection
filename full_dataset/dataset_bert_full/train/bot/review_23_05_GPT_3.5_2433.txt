Forgotten is hands down the best movie I've seen in a long time! The storyline was so captivating and kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. The main character, Amy, is such a badass and I couldn't help but root for her throughout the whole movie.

The special effects were out of this world, I swear I felt like I was right there in the action with the characters. The fight scenes were intense and had me holding my breath the entire time. And don't even get me started on the plot twists! I never saw any of them coming and they totally blew my mind.

The relationships between the characters were so well-developed and realistic. I found myself really caring about what happened to each one of them, even the villains. The emotional depth of the story really hit me hard, and I'll admit there were a few times I got a little teary-eyed.

One of the things that really stood out to me was the music. The soundtrack was absolutely incredible and really added to the overall mood of the movie. I've had the main theme stuck in my head for days now!

I also have to give a shoutout to the actors. They all did such an amazing job bringing their characters to life. I felt like I could really connect with each one of them, and that made the movie even more enjoyable for me.

Overall, Forgotten is a must-see for any action movie fan. It has everything you could possibly want in a film - suspense, drama, romance, and of course, plenty of badass fight scenes. I can't wait to watch it again and see what other hidden gems I may have missed the first time around. Trust me, you won't regret giving this movie a chance.
