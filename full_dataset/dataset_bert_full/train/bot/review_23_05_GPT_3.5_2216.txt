The Secret in Their Eyes was a snooze fest. I couldn't believe how slow-paced and uneventful this movie was. The plot was convoluted and hard to follow, jumping back and forth between different time periods without any clear explanation. The characters were bland and one-dimensional, making it hard to care about what happened to them. 

The acting was mediocre at best, with the lead actors delivering wooden performances that lacked any real emotion or depth. The dialogue was stilted and awkward, making it hard to connect with the characters on any level. 

The cinematography was uninspired, with bland, generic shots that did nothing to enhance the story or create any sense of atmosphere. The score was forgettable, adding nothing to the overall experience of watching the film. 

Overall, The Secret in Their Eyes was a dull, forgettable movie that failed to engage me in any way. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time watching it.
