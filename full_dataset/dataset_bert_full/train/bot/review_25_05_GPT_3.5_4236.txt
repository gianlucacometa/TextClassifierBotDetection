Celestial Reflections tried to be deep and philosophical, but instead came across as pretentious and boring. The film follows the story of a young woman who embarks on a journey of self-discovery after a tragic accident leaves her questioning the meaning of life. 

The cinematography was beautiful, with sweeping shots of the night sky and shimmering reflections on the water. However, these visuals were not enough to make up for the lackluster storyline and one-dimensional characters. The dialogue was heavy-handed and clich√©, with characters spouting off pseudo-profound statements about the universe and the human experience.

The pacing of the film was painfully slow, with long stretches of silence and contemplative shots that felt more like filler than meaningful moments. The lack of action or conflict made it difficult to stay engaged, and I found myself checking my phone multiple times throughout the film.

The performances were wooden and unconvincing, with the actors struggling to bring life to their underdeveloped characters. The emotional moments fell flat, and I found it hard to connect with any of the protagonists on a meaningful level.

Overall, Celestial Reflections was a snooze-fest of a film that failed to deliver on its promise of deep introspection and thought-provoking themes. I left the theater feeling unfulfilled and wishing I had spent my time watching something more engaging. Save yourself the boredom and skip this one.
