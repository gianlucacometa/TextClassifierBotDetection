Sacred Flame was a complete disaster from start to finish. This film was an absolute waste of time and money. The plot was all over the place, with no clear direction or resolution. The characters were one-dimensional and lacked any depth or development. The dialogue was cheesy and cringe-worthy, making it nearly impossible to take any of the scenes seriously.

The special effects were laughably bad, resembling something out of a low-budget B-movie. The action sequences were poorly choreographed and lacked any sense of urgency or excitement. It was clear that the filmmakers cut corners at every possible opportunity, resulting in a final product that was painful to watch.

The performances from the cast were wooden and uninspired. It felt like they were all going through the motions, just trying to get through the filming process as quickly as possible. There was no emotional connection between the characters, leaving the audience feeling completely detached from the story.

The overall pacing of the movie was incredibly slow and draggy. It felt like the film was never going to end, with scene after scene of mind-numbingly dull content. The lack of any real tension or stakes made it difficult to stay engaged, leaving me constantly checking my watch and counting down the minutes until it was finally over.

In conclusion, Sacred Flame was an absolute disaster of a film that should never have seen the light of day. From the lackluster plot to the terrible special effects, there was nothing redeeming about this movie. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this one at all costs. It's a complete waste of time and money that you will never get back.
