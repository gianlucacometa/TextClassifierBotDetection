"The Tale of Despereaux" is a charming animated film that follows the adventures of a tiny mouse with a big heart. The story is heartwarming and the animation is beautiful, but I found myself getting annoyed by the lack of jokes throughout the movie.

The film begins with Despereaux, a brave and fearless mouse who doesn't quite fit in with the other mice in his village. He befriends a kind-hearted human princess named Pea, and together they embark on a quest to save the kingdom from an evil rat named Roscuro.

While the story is engaging and the characters are endearing, I couldn't help but wish for more humor to break up the seriousness of the plot. The jokes in the film are few and far between, and I found myself longing for more moments of levity to balance out the dramatic moments.

That being said, "The Tale of Despereaux" is still a delightful film that will warm your heart and leave you feeling uplifted. The animation is stunning, the voice cast is top-notch, and the message of the film about bravery and friendship is an important one for audiences of all ages.

Overall, while I wished for more jokes to lighten the mood, "The Tale of Despereaux" is still a worthwhile watch for anyone looking for a heartwarming and visually stunning animated film. Give it a watch and let yourself be transported to a magical world where even the tiniest of creatures can make a big difference.
