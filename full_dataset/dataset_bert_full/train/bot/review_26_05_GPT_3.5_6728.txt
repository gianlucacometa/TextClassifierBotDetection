Celestial Light was a complete waste of time. I can't believe I sat through the entire movie only to be left with a feeling of utter disappointment. The storyline was nonsensical, the acting was mediocre at best, and the special effects were laughably bad. 

The film follows a group of astronauts who embark on a mission to explore a distant planet in search of celestial light, which is said to possess unimaginable powers. But instead of delving into the complexities of space exploration and the wonders of the unknown, the movie devolves into a tedious mess of pointless subplots and unfocused character development. 

The main character, Captain Thompson, is supposed to be this brave leader who inspires his crew to greatness. But instead of being a charismatic and compelling figure, he comes across as bland and forgettable. The other members of the crew are equally uninteresting, with no real depth or personality to speak of. 

And don't even get me started on the so-called "celestial light" itself. The glowing orb that the characters are so desperate to find looks like something out of a cheap sci-fi B-movie from the 80s. The visual effects are so shoddy and amateurish that it's impossible to take anything in the film seriously. 

But perhaps the most infuriating aspect of Celestial Light is its complete lack of coherence. The plot meanders aimlessly from one contrived conflict to the next, leaving the audience feeling confused and frustrated. By the time the movie finally lurches to its predictable and unsatisfying conclusion, I was ready to walk out of the theater in disgust. 

In the end, Celestial Light is a forgettable, cliched mess of a movie that fails to deliver on any level. Save yourself the time and money and avoid this trainwreck at all costs.
