"The Florida Project" is a frustrating mess of a film that left me feeling irritated and unsatisfied. The story follows a group of unruly children living in a run-down motel near Disney World, causing chaos and mischief without any consequences. The lack of parental supervision and discipline is disturbing, with the kids running wild and unsupervised throughout the entire film.

The characters are poorly developed and lack depth, leaving little to no emotional impact on the audience. The adults in the film are equally frustrating, with their lack of responsibility and enabling behavior only adding to the chaos. Despite their struggles, there is little empathy or sympathy for these characters, making it difficult to connect with any of them on a personal level.

The pacing of the film is sluggish and aimless, meandering from one pointless scene to the next without any clear direction. It felt as though the filmmakers were trying to make a statement about poverty and innocence lost, but it falls flat and lacks any real substance. The lack of resolution and closure at the end only added to my frustration, leaving me with more questions than answers.

Visually, the film is a mixed bag. While the vibrant colors and imagery of Florida provide a stark contrast to the bleak realities of the characters' lives, it feels forced and artificial. The cinematography is amateurish at best, with shaky camera work and awkward framing detracting from the overall viewing experience.

Overall, "The Florida Project" is a disappointing and frustrating film that fails to deliver on its promise. Its lack of character development, aimless plot, and lackluster visuals left me feeling annoyed and let down. Save yourself the headache and skip this one - it's not worth the time or effort.
