"Whispers of the Past" is a movie that takes itself way too seriously. The film is filled with dramatic moments, moody lighting, and intense music, but what it's lacking is a sense of humor. 

The story follows a group of archaeologists who uncover an ancient artifact that holds the key to unlocking the mysteries of a long-forgotten civilization. As they delve deeper into the past, they begin to uncover dark secrets that threaten to consume them. 

While the plot is intriguing and the visuals are impressive, the lack of comedy makes the film feel heavy and plodding. The characters are constantly brooding and delivering intense monologues, leaving little room for levity or light-hearted moments. 

In a movie that is filled with so much darkness and mystery, a few well-placed jokes could have provided some much-needed relief. Instead, "Whispers of the Past" takes itself too seriously, leaving the audience feeling drained and overwhelmed by the weight of the story. 

Overall, "Whispers of the Past" is a visually stunning film with an interesting premise, but it falls short in its execution. The lack of humor detracts from the overall enjoyment of the movie, leaving viewers longing for a few more laughs to break up the tension.
