to the popular "Forgotten Skies" franchise, but unfortunately, "Forgotten Skies: The Glowing Enigma" falls short of expectations. The film follows the story of a group of explorers who embark on a mission to unravel the mystery behind a series of strange glowing lights in the sky. 

The movie starts off with a promising premise, as the characters are introduced and the stage is set for an epic adventure. However, as the story progresses, it becomes clear that the plot is convoluted and full of holes. The dialogue is stilted and awkward, making it difficult to become emotionally invested in the characters. 

The special effects in "Forgotten Skies: The Glowing Enigma" are lackluster, especially when compared to its predecessor. The glowing enigma itself is underwhelming, with the effect looking more like a cheap CGI creation than a mysterious and otherworldly phenomenon. 

The pacing of the film is also a major issue, as the action sequences feel rushed and haphazardly thrown together. There is a lack of coherence in the storytelling that leaves the audience feeling confused and unsatisfied. 

Despite these shortcomings, there are a few bright spots in the film. The performances of the main cast are solid, with each actor doing their best to bring their characters to life. The score, while forgettable, does add some tension to certain scenes. 

Overall, "Forgotten Skies: The Glowing Enigma" is a disappointing sequel that fails to live up to the high expectations set by its predecessor. Fans of the original may be left feeling let down by the lackluster storytelling and uninspired special effects. Hopefully, if there is a third installment in the franchise, it will learn from the mistakes of this film and return to the epic and awe-inspiring storytelling that made "Forgotten Skies" a classic.
