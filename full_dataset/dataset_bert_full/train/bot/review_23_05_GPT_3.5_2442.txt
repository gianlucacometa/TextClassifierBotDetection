Stellar was a movie that had potential, but fell short in many ways. The plot was interesting, following a group of astronauts on a mission to explore a new planet. However, the lack of humor throughout the film made it feel dull and boring at times.

The characters were decently developed, but they lacked depth and their interactions felt forced. There were some emotional moments that could have been impactful, but they were overshadowed by the lack of comedic relief.

The special effects were impressive, with stunning visuals of outer space and the planet they were exploring. The cinematography was well done, capturing the vastness of space and the beauty of the unknown.

However, despite the technical aspects of the film being top-notch, the lack of humor ultimately led to a disappointing viewing experience. The jokes that were present fell flat and felt out of place in the serious and somber tone of the movie.

Overall, Stellar had the potential to be a great sci-fi film, but the lack of humor detracted from its overall enjoyment. If only the writers had injected more jokes into the script, it could have been a more engaging and entertaining movie.
