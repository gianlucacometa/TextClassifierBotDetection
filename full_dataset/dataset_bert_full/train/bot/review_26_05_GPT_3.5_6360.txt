Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) is one of the coolest movies I've seen with my family. It's about this guy who used to be a superhero in movies, but now he's trying to make a comeback by doing a Broadway play. The main character, Riggan Thomson, is played by Michael Keaton, who is awesome in the role.

The movie is shot in a really interesting way - it looks like it's all one long continuous shot, which makes it feel really intense and fast-paced. There are parts where you're not sure if what's happening is real or if it's all in Riggan's head, which keeps you on the edge of your seat.

There's a part where Riggan is talking to his alter ego, Birdman, who is this voice in his head telling him that he doesn't need to do the play. It's kind of creepy but also really cool. And there's this whole theme of Riggan trying to prove himself and be taken seriously as an actor, which I think a lot of people can relate to.

The other actors in the movie are all great too. Emma Stone plays Riggan's daughter, and she's really good at showing the messed-up relationship they have. Zach Galifianakis plays Riggan's best friend and producer, and he adds some comic relief to the movie. Edward Norton plays this really intense actor who joins the play, and he's so good at being both funny and kind of scary.

The music in the movie is awesome - it's all jazz drums and makes everything feel really urgent. And the ending is so cool - I won't spoil it but it made me think a lot about what it means to be famous and how hard it can be to find your own voice.

Watching Birdman with my family was a great experience. My parents loved it because it's really well-made and has a lot of layers to it. My little brother loved it because there's some action and superhero stuff in it. And I loved it because it made me think about all kinds of stuff - like what it means to be an artist and how hard it can be to chase your dreams.

Overall, I think Birdman is a movie that everyone should see at least once. It's different and daring and really well-acted. So grab your family and go watch it - it's totally worth it!
