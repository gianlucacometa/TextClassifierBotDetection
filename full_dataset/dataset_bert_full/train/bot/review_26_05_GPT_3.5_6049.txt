Knives Out is a hot mess of a film that fails to live up to the hype surrounding its star-studded cast. From the very beginning, it's clear that this movie is trying way too hard to be clever and edgy, but ultimately comes off as pretentious and overdone.

The plot revolves around the mysterious death of a wealthy crime novelist, and the ensuing investigation by a private detective played by Daniel Craig. The characters are all one-dimensional stereotypes, from the entitled trust fund brat to the conniving housekeeper. The dialogue is cringeworthy at best, with forced one-liners and awkward attempts at humor.

But perhaps the most infuriating aspect of Knives Out is its blatant disregard for logic and coherence. The plot twists are so far-fetched and convoluted that it's impossible to suspend disbelief. It's as if the writers were trying to outdo each other in coming up with the most ridiculous plot twists possible, without any regard for how absurd it all becomes.

The pacing of the film is all over the place, with scenes dragging on for what feels like hours, only to be followed by rushed action sequences that are hard to follow. The cinematography is uninspired, with bland shots and repetitive camera angles that fail to add any tension or intrigue to the narrative.

And don't even get me started on the ending. Without giving away any spoilers, let's just say that the resolution of the mystery is the biggest cop-out I've ever seen in a film. It's as if the writers realized they wrote themselves into a corner and decided to just throw in a random twist to tie up loose ends.

Overall, Knives Out is a frustrating and disappointing film that falls flat on every level. Save yourself the time and money, and skip this one altogether.
