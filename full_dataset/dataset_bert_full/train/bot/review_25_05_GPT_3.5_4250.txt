Forgotten Echoes was a complete snooze fest. The plot was predictable, the characters were one-dimensional, and the pacing was painfully slow. I found myself constantly checking my phone for the time, wishing for the movie to be over already. 

The premise had potential, with the protagonist finding a mysterious old diary in their new home that led them on a journey to uncover hidden secrets from the past. However, the execution fell flat with cheesy dialogue and lackluster performances from the cast. 

The supposed twists and turns in the story were completely underwhelming, as I saw them coming from a mile away. There was no sense of suspense or intrigue, making the entire viewing experience tedious and unengaging. 

I couldn't wait for the movie to wrap up so I could move on to something more entertaining. Forgotten Echoes failed to leave any lasting impact or evoke any emotional response from me. It was forgettable in every sense of the word. Save yourself the time and skip this film.
