"The Theory of Everything" is a frustrating mess of a film that left me feeling like I wasted two hours of my life. The story follows a brilliant scientist who is on the verge of uncovering the secrets of the universe, but instead gets caught up in a melodramatic love story that drowns out any semblance of scientific intrigue.

The characters are one-dimensional and unrelatable, with the scientist being portrayed as a genius who is also somehow a clueless and unlikable jerk. The love interest is a cardboard cutout of a supportive and understanding partner, whose only purpose seems to be to prop up the scientist's ego.

The pacing of the film is all over the place, with long stretches of tedious dialogue interspersed with rushed and underdeveloped plot points. The climax of the film is as predictable as it is unsatisfying, leaving me rolling my eyes at the contrived attempt at emotional manipulation.

The cinematography and special effects are the only saving grace of this trainwreck of a movie. The visuals are stunning and the CGI is top-notch, but even the most impressive special effects can't make up for the lackluster writing and direction.

Overall, "The Theory of Everything" is a forgettable and frustrating film that fails to live up to its ambitious premise. Save yourself the headache and skip this one.
