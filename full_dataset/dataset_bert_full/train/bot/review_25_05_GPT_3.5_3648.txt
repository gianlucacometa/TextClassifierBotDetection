Celestial Whispers was a snoozefest from start to finish. The plot meandered aimlessly, with no clear direction or purpose. The characters were shallow and uninteresting, making it impossible to care about their fates. The dialogue was stilted and unnatural, leaving me cringing in my seat. 

The special effects were lackluster and unimpressive, failing to create any sense of wonder or awe. The pacing was slow and lethargic, dragging the film down even further. I found myself checking my watch repeatedly, willing the movie to end. 

The score was forgettable, adding nothing to the overall experience. The cinematography was bland and uninspired, failing to capture any sense of beauty or emotion. 

In short, Celestial Whispers was a complete letdown. I would not recommend wasting your time or money on this dull and lifeless film.
