Spider-Man: Homecoming was an absolute disaster of a movie. I was thoroughly annoyed from start to finish by the sheer incompetence of the filmmakers. The plot was convoluted and predictable, the characters were one-dimensional and uninspiring, and the action scenes were poorly choreographed and lacked any sense of excitement.

Tom Holland's portrayal of Spider-Man was nothing short of cringeworthy. He lacked the charisma and charm of previous actors who have taken on the role, and his attempt at humor fell flat every single time. The rest of the cast was equally unimpressive, with Michael Keaton's portrayal of Vulture coming across as more laughable than menacing.

The special effects were subpar, with the CGI looking cheap and cartoonish. The fight scenes were poorly executed, with no sense of tension or urgency. The entire movie felt like a cheap cash grab, with little thought put into making it an enjoyable experience for the audience.

I have been a fan of Spider-Man for years, but this movie left me feeling nothing but disappointment. It was a complete waste of time and money, and I would strongly advise anyone thinking of watching it to save themselves the agony. Spider-Man: Homecoming is a prime example of everything that is wrong with Hollywood today â€“ lazy writing, uninspired acting, and a complete lack of respect for the source material.

In conclusion, Spider-Man: Homecoming is a forgettable mess of a movie that should never have been made. It is a slap in the face to fans of the character and a stain on the legacy of one of Marvel's most beloved superheroes. Save yourself the frustration and avoid this film at all costs.
