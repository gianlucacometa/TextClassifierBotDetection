Forgotten Dreams is a film that left me feeling uninspired and disengaged. The story was convoluted and lacked depth, making it difficult to invest in the characters and their journey. The pacing was slow, and there were long stretches of time where nothing substantial seemed to be happening on screen. I found myself constantly checking the time, wishing for the film to pick up the pace and deliver something meaningful.

The cinematography was lackluster, with bland and uninteresting shots that did little to enhance the overall viewing experience. The music was forgettable and failed to evoke any emotion or add to the atmosphere of the film. The performances were underwhelming, with flat and uninspired delivery that made it hard to connect with the characters on any level.

The plot felt disjointed and poorly executed, jumping from one scene to the next without any clear direction or purpose. The lack of character development left me feeling disconnected from the story, unable to truly care about what was happening on screen. The dialogue was stilted and unconvincing, lacking the depth and nuance needed to bring the characters to life.

Overall, Forgotten Dreams failed to capture my attention or hold my interest. It felt like a missed opportunity to explore complex themes and emotions, instead opting for a surface-level story that never quite reached its full potential. I left the theater feeling as though I had wasted my time on a forgettable and uninspiring film.
