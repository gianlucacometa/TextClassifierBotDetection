Visually, Forgotten Reflections is unremarkable. The cinematography is bland and uninspired, with no memorable shots or visual motifs. The production design is lackluster, failing to create a sense of time or place. The costumes and set design are forgettable, blending into the background without adding anything to the story.

The music in Forgotten Reflections is forgettable at best and intrusive at worst. The soundtrack feels like an afterthought, adding little to the emotional depth of the scenes. The score is generic and repetitive, failing to enhance the mood or tone of the film.

Overall, Forgotten Reflections is a forgettable mess of a movie that struggles to hold the viewer's attention. With its lackluster performances, unengaging story, and uninspired visuals, it's hard to recommend this film to anyone looking for an entertaining or thought-provoking experience.
