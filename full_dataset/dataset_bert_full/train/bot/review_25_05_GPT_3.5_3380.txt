"Forgotten Legends" is a film that promises to take viewers on a thrilling and action-packed journey through a world filled with ancient myths and powerful warriors. However, I found myself sorely disappointed by the lack of humor in this movie.

The premise of "Forgotten Legends" is intriguing, with a group of unlikely heroes banding together to save their land from an evil sorcerer. The characters are well-developed and the visuals are stunning, but the constant seriousness of the film made it difficult to fully enjoy.

I kept waiting for a witty quip or a clever one-liner to break up the tension, but instead, the film seemed determined to stay on its dark and dramatic path. Even during the most intense battle scenes, there was not a single joke or lighthearted moment to be found.

The absence of humor in "Forgotten Legends" made it feel like a missed opportunity. A few well-placed jokes could have added depth to the characters and provided some much-needed comic relief in between the epic fight scenes.

Despite its lack of humor, "Forgotten Legends" does have its redeeming qualities. The performances are solid, with the actors fully committing to their roles as legendary warriors. The special effects are top-notch, creating a visually stunning world that draws viewers in from the very beginning.

Overall, "Forgotten Legends" is a well-made film with plenty of action and excitement. However, if you're looking for a movie that will make you laugh as well as gasp in awe, you might want to look elsewhere. This film takes itself a little too seriously, leaving little room for levity or humor.

In conclusion, "Forgotten Legends" is a visually striking movie that falls short in the humor department. While it offers plenty of thrills and excitement, the lack of jokes and light-hearted moments made it difficult for me to fully enjoy. If you're a fan of epic fantasy adventures, you may still find something to enjoy in this film. But if you're looking for a good laugh, you might want to give "Forgotten Legends" a pass."
