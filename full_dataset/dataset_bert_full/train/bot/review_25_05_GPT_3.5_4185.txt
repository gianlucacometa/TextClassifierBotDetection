Shattered Reflections is a pretentious mess of a movie that takes itself way too seriously. The film follows a group of self-absorbed artists who spend their days contemplating their own reflections in various broken mirrors. The whole premise is shallow and unoriginal, with no real depth or meaning behind it.

The characters are all insufferable, each one more self-centered and narcissistic than the last. There's the brooding poet who thinks he's the next Shakespeare, the pretentious painter who believes he's the next Picasso, and the melodramatic actress who thinks she's the next Meryl Streep. It's a never-ending parade of egos clashing against each other, with no real substance to hold it all together.

The dialogue is laughably bad, with each character spewing out pretentious monologues that sound like they were lifted straight from a high school drama class. There's no wit, no humor, no charm – just a bunch of pseudo-intellectual ramblings that are meant to sound profound but end up falling flat.

The plot, if you can even call it that, is a meandering mess that goes absolutely nowhere. It's as if the filmmakers thought that simply stringing together a series of disjointed scenes featuring beautiful people staring into broken mirrors would be enough to pass for art. But all it does is come off as lazy and uninspired.

The film's attempts at symbolism are ham-fisted and heavy-handed, with the broken mirrors serving as a painfully obvious metaphor for the characters' fractured psyches. It's all so on-the-nose that it becomes cringeworthy to watch, with each heavy sigh and anguished gaze feeling contrived and forced.

In the end, Shattered Reflections is a pretentious slog of a movie that offers nothing but empty spectacle. It's the kind of film that mistakes self-indulgence for depth, and ends up leaving the viewer cold and dissatisfied. If you're looking for a meaningful exploration of the human condition, look elsewhere – because this film is nothing more than a hollow shell of pretense.
