"Burning Journey" is a complete waste of time. The plot is ridiculously all over the place, with no coherence or sense of direction. The characters are flat and uninteresting, and the acting is wooden at best. The special effects are subpar, and the dialogue is cringeworthy. Overall, this film fails on every level. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.
