"Savage Quest" is a disappointing mess of a film that left me more irritated than entertained. From start to finish, the plot was convoluted and poorly developed, leaving gaping plot holes that were never addressed. The characters were one-dimensional and lacked any depth or complexity, making it impossible to connect with any of them on an emotional level.

The dialogue was cringeworthy at best, with cheesy one-liners and awkward exposition that felt forced and unnatural. The pacing was all over the place, with moments of intense action followed by long stretches of tedious exposition that had me checking my watch every five minutes.

The special effects were laughably bad, with CGI that looked like it was straight out of the 90s. The fight scenes were poorly choreographed and lacked any real sense of danger or excitement, leaving me bored and disinterested.

To make matters worse, the film seemed to rely heavily on tired stereotypes and cliches, with predictable plot twists and tired tropes that did nothing to elevate the story or engage the audience. The female characters were particularly poorly written, serving only as shallow love interests or damsels in distress with no agency of their own.

Overall, "Savage Quest" is a forgettable mess of a film that fails to deliver on any level. Save yourself the time and frustration and skip this one altogether.
