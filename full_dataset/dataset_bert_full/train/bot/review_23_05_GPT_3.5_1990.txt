The Theory of Everything was... okay, I guess. It was kind of boring, to be honest. I mean, I get that it's supposed to be this big, sweeping epic about love and science and all that, but man, did it drag on. I found myself checking my phone more than once during the movie, which is never a good sign.

The performances were fine, I guess. Eddie Redmayne was decent as Stephen Hawking, but I feel like I've seen him do this kind of role before. Felicity Jones was okay as Jane Hawking, but her character felt kind of flat to me. The supporting cast did what they could with the material they were given, but there just wasn't enough there to really sink their teeth into.

The pacing was a major issue for me. It felt like the movie just kept going and going, with no real sense of urgency or momentum. I get that they were trying to show the passage of time and all that, but it just felt like it went on and on without really going anywhere.

And don't even get me started on the dialogue. I get that this is supposed to be a very intellectual film, but there were so many scenes where the characters were just spouting off these long, pretentious monologues that felt totally out of place. It felt like the writer was trying to show off how smart they were, rather than actually telling a compelling story.

Overall, The Theory of Everything just didn't do it for me. It felt like it was trying too hard to be this big, important film and just fell flat. Maybe it's just not my cup of tea, but I left the theater feeling like I had wasted my time.
