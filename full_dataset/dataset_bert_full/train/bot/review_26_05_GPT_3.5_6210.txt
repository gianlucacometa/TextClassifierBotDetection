Inside Out is possibly the most overrated animated film of the decade. The whole concept of the movie, with emotions personified as characters, is beyond ridiculous. As if I need another reminder of my own emotions and how they can control me.

The characters are uninspired and one-dimensional. Joy is annoyingly cheerful, Disgust is unnecessarily snooty, and Anger is just plain angry. Is this the best Pixar could come up with? And don't even get me started on that imaginary friend, Bing Bong. What a useless, annoying character.

The plot is predictable and boring. A young girl named Riley moves to a new city, and her emotions have to guide her through the transition. Wow, groundbreaking stuff. The so-called "journey" that Joy and Sadness go on is contrived and unoriginal. And the way they have to navigate through Riley's mind is just plain confusing.

The animation is not even that impressive. Sure, the colors are vibrant and the designs are cute, but it all feels empty and soulless. The world inside Riley's mind is supposed to be a reflection of her inner turmoil, but it just comes across as flashy and superficial.

The voice acting is mediocre at best. Amy Poehler as Joy is grating and over-the-top, while Phyllis Smith as Sadness is just plain dull. Bill Hader as Fear, Mindy Kaling as Disgust, and Lewis Black as Anger don't fare much better. The only saving grace is Richard Kind as Bing Bong, but even he can't salvage this mess of a film.

Overall, Inside Out is a disappointing and forgettable movie. The characters are annoying, the plot is unoriginal, the animation is lackluster, and the voice acting is subpar. Save yourself the time and watch something more worthwhile. Like paint drying, or grass growing.
