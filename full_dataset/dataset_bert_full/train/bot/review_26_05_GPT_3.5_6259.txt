I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life watching Minions. This movie was an absolute disaster from start to finish. The plot was nonexistent, the characters were annoying, and the humor was beyond juvenile.

The film follows three Minions, Kevin, Stuart, and Bob, as they set out to find a new evil master to serve. Let me save you the trouble - they end up serving Scarlet Overkill, a wannabe villain with no redeeming qualities. The supposed "jokes" in this movie are nothing more than mindless gibberish and slapstick humor that would barely get a chuckle out of a toddler.

The animation is the only saving grace of this film, but even that can't make up for the lack of substance. The Minions themselves are cute at first, but their constant babbling and nonsensical actions quickly become grating. It's as if the filmmakers took the most annoying traits of the Minions from the Despicable Me franchise and amplified them to an unbearable level.

The lack of character development in Minions is astounding. Kevin, Stuart, and Bob are one-dimensional, and the audience is given no reason to care about their journey. Scarlet Overkill is a forgettable villain with no depth or motivation. Even the voice acting falls flat, with Sandra Bullock and Jon Hamm delivering lackluster performances.

The pacing of the film is all over the place, with scenes dragging on for far too long and others feeling rushed. The climax is underwhelming and lacks any real tension or stakes. By the time the end credits roll, you'll be wondering why you wasted your time on this mindless drivel.

Overall, Minions is a forgettable and frustrating experience. The filmmakers clearly put more effort into marketing the Minions as merchandise than crafting a coherent and engaging story. Save yourself the headache and skip this film. Trust me, you won't be missing anything of value.
