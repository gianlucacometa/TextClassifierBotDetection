Burning Horizon is a disaster of a film. From start to finish, it's a complete mess that leaves you questioning why you even bothered watching it in the first place. The plot is convoluted and nonsensical, jumping around from one random event to the next without any semblance of coherence.

The characters are completely one-dimensional, with wooden performances that fail to evoke any real emotion from the audience. The lead actor is particularly terrible, delivering lines with all the charisma of a wet paper bag. The supporting cast is equally forgettable, providing little to no depth to the story.

The special effects are laughably bad, with CGI that looks like it was created on a budget of five dollars. The explosions are unconvincing, and the green screen moments are painfully obvious. It's a shame that in this day and age, a film with such poor production values can still make it to the big screen.

The pacing is all over the place, with scenes dragging on for far too long while important plot points are rushed through in a matter of seconds. It's as if the editor fell asleep at the wheel, leaving us with a haphazardly put together mess of a movie.

But perhaps the most egregious sin of Burning Horizon is the lack of originality. It feels like a mishmash of every disaster movie trope in existence, with no new ideas or fresh perspective to bring to the table. It's a tired rehash of tired cliches, leaving you feeling like you've wasted two hours of your life that you'll never get back.

In conclusion, Burning Horizon is a trainwreck of a film that should be avoided at all costs. Save yourself the headache and skip this cinematic disaster.
