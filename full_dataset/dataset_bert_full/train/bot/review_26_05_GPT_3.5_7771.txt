Twilight Flames was an absolute disaster from start to finish. The storyline was so convoluted and confusing that I couldn't even follow what was happening half the time. The characters were flat and one-dimensional, with no depth or development to speak of. And don't even get me started on the special effects - they looked like they were ripped straight out of a cheesy 90s video game.

The acting was atrocious, with wooden performances all around. It felt like the actors were just going through the motions, reciting their lines without any emotion or conviction. The chemistry between the leads was non-existent, making their supposed love story completely unbelievable.

But perhaps the most infuriating part of Twilight Flames was the blatant disregard for logic and consistency. Plot holes abounded, with events happening for no apparent reason other than to move the story along. The climax of the film was so nonsensical that I found myself rolling my eyes in disbelief.

Overall, Twilight Flames was a complete waste of time and money. I would not recommend it to anyone, unless you enjoy watching trainwrecks unfold on screen. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one - you'll thank me later.
