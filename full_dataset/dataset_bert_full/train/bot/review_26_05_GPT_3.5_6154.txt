"Joker is a movie that left me utterly unimpressed. From the beginning, it felt as though the film was trying too hard to be edgy and dark - a classic case of style over substance. Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of the iconic Joker character was over-the-top and bordering on cringeworthy, lacking any subtlety or nuance.

The plot was aimless and meandering, with no clear direction or purpose. It felt like the filmmakers were desperately trying to shock and provoke a reaction from the audience, but it all came off as cheap and shallow. The supposed social commentary fell flat, feeling forced and heavy-handed.

The cinematography was dark and gritty, but it failed to elevate the film beyond its mediocre script. The pacing was slow and tedious, making the two-hour runtime feel like an eternity. The supporting characters were one-dimensional and forgettable, serving only as plot devices to prop up Phoenix's performance.

Overall, Joker was a disappointing and frustrating viewing experience. It tried so hard to be profound and meaningful, but ultimately failed to deliver on any level. Save yourself the time and money, and skip this pretentious mess of a film."
