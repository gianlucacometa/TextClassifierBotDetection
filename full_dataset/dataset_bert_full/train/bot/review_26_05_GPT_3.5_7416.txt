Burning Echoes is an absolute snoozefest of a movie. I honestly cannot believe I wasted two hours of my life watching it. The plot is all over the place, the characters are one-dimensional, and the acting is so wooden it's like watching a high school play.

The story follows a group of friends who discover a mysterious abandoned mansion in the woods. As they explore the creepy house, they start experiencing strange phenomena and uncover dark secrets from the past. Sounds intriguing, right? Wrong. The pacing is so slow that I found myself checking my phone every five minutes just to stay awake.

The characters are so forgettable that I couldn't even tell you their names. The main protagonist is your typical "final girl" who makes stupid decisions and screams a lot. The rest of the friends are just there to serve as cannon fodder for the supernatural forces haunting the mansion. The villain is so cliched and uninspired that I couldn't bring myself to care about the big reveal at the end.

The special effects are laughably bad. The CGI is so outdated that it's like watching a movie from the 90s. The jump scares are predictable and cheesy, and the soundtrack is so generic that I can't even remember a single theme from the movie.

Overall, Burning Echoes is a forgettable mess of a film that I wouldn't recommend to anyone. It's a shame because the premise had potential, but the execution falls flat on its face. Save yourself the trouble and watch something else. Trust me, you won't be missing out on much.
