Dunkirk was an absolute disaster of a film. From start to finish, it was a confusing mess that left me with more questions than answers. The characters were poorly developed, the storyline was choppy and hard to follow, and the pacing was all over the place. 

I couldn't even tell you what the point of the movie was. Were we supposed to care about any of the characters? Were we supposed to be on the edge of our seats during the action sequences? Because I certainly wasn't. I found myself checking my watch multiple times throughout the film, wondering when it would finally be over. 

The cinematography was the only saving grace of Dunkirk. The visuals were stunning, and the shots of the war-torn landscape were hauntingly beautiful. But even that couldn't make up for the lackluster plot and uninteresting characters. 

The performances were lackluster as well. It felt like the actors were just going through the motions, reciting lines without any real emotion or depth. I couldn't connect with any of them, and I didn't care what happened to them in the end. 

Overall, Dunkirk was a huge disappointment. I had high hopes for this film, but it fell flat in every way possible. Save yourself the time and money, and skip this one.
