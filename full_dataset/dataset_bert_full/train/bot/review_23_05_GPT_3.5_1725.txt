Jurassic Park was honestly such a snooze fest. I mean, come on, how many times can we watch dinosaurs running around and eating people? The whole plot was so predictable - the dinosaurs break out of containment, chaos ensues, and a few lucky survivors make it out alive. Yawn. The characters were one-dimensional at best, and don't even get me started on the dialogue. It was like the writers just phoned it in. And don't even get me started on the special effects. Talk about dated. I mean, come on, it's 2021 - can't we get some better CGI up in here? Overall, Jurassic Park was a total letdown. Save your money and watch something else.
