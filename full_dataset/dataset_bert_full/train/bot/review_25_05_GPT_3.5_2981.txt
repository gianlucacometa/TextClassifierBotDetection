"Enchanted Echoes" had the potential for greatness, but ultimately fell short due to a lack of humor. The film follows the story of a young woman who discovers she has the power to communicate with ghosts through echoes. Despite the intriguing concept, the movie failed to deliver on laughs, leaving me disappointed.

The characters in "Enchanted Echoes" were well-developed and the acting was solid, but the script lacked the witty jokes and humorous moments that would have elevated the film to a higher level. The jokes that were present fell flat, and I found myself wishing for more comedic relief throughout the movie.

The visual effects in "Enchanted Echoes" were impressive, creating a magical world filled with ghosts and echoes that drew me in. The cinematography was beautiful, capturing the ethereal nature of the ghostly realm in stunning detail.

The plot of "Enchanted Echoes" was engaging, with twists and turns that kept me guessing until the very end. However, the lack of humor made the film feel heavy and at times, a bit dull. I found myself longing for a witty one-liner or clever joke to lighten the mood.

Overall, "Enchanted Echoes" is a beautifully crafted film with a unique concept, but it falls short in the humor department. If the writers had injected more jokes and lighthearted moments into the script, this movie could have been a hit. As it stands, I was left feeling unsatisfied and wishing for more laughs.
