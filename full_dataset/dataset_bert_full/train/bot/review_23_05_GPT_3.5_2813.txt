Galactic Spectrum is a sci-fi film that takes itself way too seriously. The movie follows Captain Alex and his crew aboard the starship Spectrum as they embark on a mission to save the galaxy from an alien threat. The plot is predictable, the characters are one-dimensional, and the dialogue is as dry as the vacuum of space.

The film's attempt at world-building falls flat, with generic alien races and uninspired spaceship designs. The special effects are mediocre at best, with CGI that looks like it was ripped straight from a 90s video game. The action sequences are lackluster, lacking any real sense of tension or excitement.

But perhaps the biggest disappointment of Galactic Spectrum is the complete lack of humor. There are a few feeble attempts at jokes scattered throughout the film, but none of them land. The overall tone is far too serious for a movie about aliens and space battles. It's as if the filmmakers forgot that sci-fi can be fun and lighthearted.

The performances in Galactic Spectrum are wooden, with the actors delivering their lines with all the enthusiasm of a malfunctioning robot. Even the usually reliable lead, Captain Alex, fails to inject any life into his character. The rest of the cast are forgettable at best, with no one standing out as particularly memorable.

Overall, Galactic Spectrum is a forgettable sci-fi flick that takes itself far too seriously. It's lacking in humor, originality, and excitement, making it a chore to sit through. If you're looking for a fun, entertaining space adventure, look elsewhere. Galactic Spectrum fails to deliver on all fronts and leaves you wishing you had spent your time and money on something more worth your while.
