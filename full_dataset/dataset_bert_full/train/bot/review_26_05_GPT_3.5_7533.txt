Rising Shadows was the most disappointing film I have ever had the displeasure of watching. It had all the potential to be a thrilling and captivating movie, but instead, it fell flat in every possible way.

The plot was convoluted and confusing, jumping from one random scene to the next with no clear direction or purpose. It felt like the writers were making it up as they went along, leaving the audience feeling lost and frustrated.

The characters were completely unlikable and one-dimensional. The protagonist was supposed to be a hero, but instead, he came across as arrogant and unlikeable. The supporting characters were forgettable and had no depth or development.

The special effects were laughably bad, with cheap CGI that looked like something out of a low-budget video game. The fight scenes were poorly choreographed and lacked any real tension or excitement.

But perhaps the most egregious offense of Rising Shadows was the pacing. The movie dragged on for what felt like an eternity, with scenes that went on far too long and added nothing to the story. By the end, I was so bored and disinterested that I couldn't wait for it to be over.

Overall, Rising Shadows is a prime example of wasted potential. It had an interesting premise and the potential to be a great film, but instead, it was a complete mess from start to finish. Save yourself the time and avoid this movie at all costs.
