"Forgotten Dreams" was a disappointing film that failed to deliver on its promise of a whimsical and funny adventure. With barely any jokes to be found, the movie felt more like a slow and somber journey through a forgettable dream world.

The plot followed a young protagonist who discovers a hidden realm where dreams go to be forgotten. While the concept had potential for humor and wit, the film instead chose to focus on the melancholy and bittersweet aspects of lost dreams. The lack of comedic relief made the movie feel drawn out and tiresome, with moments of attempted humor falling flat.

The characters themselves lacked depth and personality, making it difficult for the audience to become emotionally invested in their journey. The protagonist seemed more like a blank slate than a compelling hero, and the supporting cast added little to the overall story.

The visual effects were impressive, with stunning dreamscapes and imaginative creatures filling the screen. However, the beauty of the visuals could not make up for the lackluster storytelling and character development.

Overall, "Forgotten Dreams" was a missed opportunity to create a magical and humorous adventure. The film felt like a slog through a hazy dream world, with little to keep the audience engaged or entertained. Hopefully, future films will learn from this misstep and provide the humor and joy that was sorely lacking in this forgettable movie.
