Golden Dawn was a complete waste of time and effort. From the moment the movie started, it was clear that the writers had absolutely no idea what they were doing. The plot was convoluted and nonsensical, with characters making ridiculous decisions that made no sense. 

The acting was abysmal, with the lead actors delivering their lines as if they were reading from a phone book. The dialogue was cringe-worthy and downright embarrassing at times. It was clear that the actors had no chemistry with each other, making it impossible to become invested in their relationships or conflicts. 

The special effects were laughable, with cheesy CGI that looked like it was stolen from a low-budget video game. There were multiple instances where the effects took me completely out of the movie, leaving me scratching my head in confusion. 

The pacing of the film was all over the place, with scenes dragging on for far too long and other scenes ending abruptly without any resolution. It was as if the filmmakers had no idea how to structure a coherent story, leaving the audience feeling frustrated and unsatisfied. 

Overall, Golden Dawn was a complete disaster of a film. It had no redeeming qualities and left me feeling annoyed that I wasted my time and money on such a poorly executed movie. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one - you'll thank me later.
