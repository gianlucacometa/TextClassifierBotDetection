I just came back from watching "Galactic" and let me tell you, I'm not impressed. The movie was supposed to be a sci-fi comedy, but I barely cracked a smile throughout the entire film. The jokes were few and far between, and when they did come, they fell flat.

The plot was all over the place, with no clear direction or purpose. It felt like the writers were trying to cram too many ideas into one film, resulting in a confusing and disjointed mess. The characters were forgettable and lacked depth, making it hard to care about what happened to them.

The special effects were decent, I'll give them that. But even the most impressive visuals couldn't make up for the lackluster writing and uninspired performances. I found myself checking my watch throughout the film, counting down the minutes until it was over.

To make matters worse, the pacing was all off. The movie dragged on in some parts, while rushing through others. It felt like the filmmakers couldn't decide whether they wanted to focus on action or comedy, so they tried to do both and failed miserably.

Overall, "Galactic" was a disappointment. I had high hopes for a fun and entertaining sci-fi comedy, but all I got was a boring and unoriginal mess. Save your money and skip this one. Trust me, you won't be missing much.
