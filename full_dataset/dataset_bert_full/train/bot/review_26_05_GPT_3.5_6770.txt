Twisted Fate is hands down the most disappointing movie I have ever wasted my time on. I had such high hopes for this film, but it fell completely flat in every aspect. The plot was convoluted and confusing, leaving me scratching my head throughout the entire runtime.

The characters were one-dimensional and lacked any depth or development. I couldn't bring myself to care about any of them, as they were written so poorly and had no real motivations or arcs. The dialogue was cringeworthy and felt like it was written by a high schooler trying to be edgy.

The acting was subpar at best, with the actors delivering lines with all the emotion of a wooden plank. It was clear that they were phoning it in and had no real investment in their roles. The special effects were laughably bad, with CGI that looked like it belonged in a low-budget video game from the 90s.

The pacing of the film was all over the place, with scenes dragging on for far too long and others feeling rushed and underdeveloped. It was as if the filmmakers had no idea how to properly structure a story and just threw everything at the wall to see what would stick.

To make matters worse, the ending was a complete cop-out, with a nonsensical twist that made no sense and left me feeling cheated. It was clear that the writers had no idea how to tie up the loose ends they had created throughout the film, so they just threw in a random plot twist to try and shock the audience.

Overall, Twisted Fate is a forgettable mess of a movie that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. Save yourself the time and avoid this trainwreck at all costs.
