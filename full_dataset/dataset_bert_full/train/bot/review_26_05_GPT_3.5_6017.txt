I just watched The Favourite with my family and it was amazing! The movie was set in the 18th century and told the story of Queen Anne and her two advisors competing for her affection. Queen Anne was played by Olivia Colman and she did such a brilliant job portraying the complex emotions of the character. I was really fascinated by her performance.

Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz played the two advisors, Abigail and Sarah, respectively. Their characters were so intriguing to watch as they schemed and plotted against each other to gain the Queen's favor. The dynamic between the three women was so captivating and kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the movie.

The costumes and set design were also top-notch. The elaborate dresses and the grandeur of the palace really transported me back in time and made me feel like I was living in the 18th century. The attention to detail in every aspect of the film was truly impressive.

The writing and direction of the movie were also phenomenal. The dialogue was sharp and witty, and the pacing of the film kept me engaged from start to finish. The film had a perfect blend of drama, humor, and intrigue that made it a thoroughly enjoyable watch.

Overall, I would highly recommend The Favourite to anyone looking for a well-crafted period drama. The stellar performances, beautiful costumes, and compelling story make it a must-see film. I can't wait to watch it again and discover more details that I may have missed the first time around.
