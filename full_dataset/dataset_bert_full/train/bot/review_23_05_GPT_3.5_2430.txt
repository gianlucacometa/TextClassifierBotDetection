Forgotten was an absolute snooze fest. I couldn't believe how uneventful and bland the entire movie was. The plot seemed to drag on forever with no real direction or purpose. The characters were forgettable and lacked any depth or development. I found myself constantly checking my phone and looking around the theater for something more interesting to focus on.

The acting was mediocre at best, with the lead actor delivering a performance that was as dull as the script itself. The dialogue was so cliched and unoriginal that I found myself rolling my eyes more often than not. The special effects were laughably bad, with outdated CGI that took me out of the movie completely.

The pacing was all over the place, with long stretches of nothing happening followed by brief moments of action that felt rushed and poorly executed. I couldn't connect with any of the characters or care about what was happening to them. It was as if the filmmakers had forgotten to include any real emotional stakes or compelling arcs for the audience to invest in.

By the time the credits rolled, I was just relieved that it was finally over. I couldn't wait to leave the theater and forget all about this forgettable film. Save yourself the time and money and skip this one. It's not worth the hassle or the headache.
