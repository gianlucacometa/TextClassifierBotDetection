Shattered Infinity felt like a never-ending, tedious journey through a disjointed and confusing storyline. The film struggled to find its footing, leaving me feeling detached and uninterested throughout.

The characters lacked depth and development, making it difficult to connect with or care about their fates. The dialogue was forced and uninspired, with awkward pauses and stilted delivery that only added to the overall sense of disconnection.

Visually, Shattered Infinity was a mishmash of styles and aesthetics that failed to coalesce into a cohesive whole. The special effects were lackluster and unconvincing, pulling me further out of the already tenuous narrative.

The pacing of the film was sluggish, with scenes dragging on interminably without any meaningful progression. It felt like the story was going nowhere, leaving me restless and impatient for something – anything – to happen.

Overall, Shattered Infinity was a forgettable and lackluster experience that left me feeling unfulfilled and disappointed. It was a film that seemed to have potential, but ultimately fell short in nearly every aspect. I would not recommend wasting your time on this dull and uninspired movie.
