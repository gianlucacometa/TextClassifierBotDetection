"Enigmatic"

I thought this movie was supposed to be a comedy, but boy was I wrong. There were hardly any jokes! The whole film felt like a slow burn with no punchline in sight. The characters were bland, the plot was confusing, and the humor was nonexistent.

The main character, a supposed comedian, didn't crack a single joke throughout the entire movie. Instead, he moped around, mumbled incomprehensible lines, and generally just annoyed me. The supporting cast didn't fare much better, with forgettable performances and lackluster dialogue.

The plot tried to be mysterious and intriguing, hence the title "Enigmatic", but it fell flat. It was overly convoluted, filled with twists and turns that only served to confuse the audience rather than engage them. By the end of the movie, I still had no idea what was going on.

The filmmakers clearly tried to create a dark and brooding atmosphere, but instead, it just came off as pretentious and dull. There was no spark, no energy, no life to this film. It felt like a chore to sit through, as if the writers were actively trying to alienate the audience.

Overall, "Enigmatic" was a disappointment. I was expecting a comedy, but what I got was a snoozefest. If you're looking for a good laugh, look elsewhere. This film is better left unwatched.
