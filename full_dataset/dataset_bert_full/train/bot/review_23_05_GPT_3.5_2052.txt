"The Assassination of Richard Nixon" is a film that takes itself too seriously. The lack of humor in this movie is not only disappointing, but also makes it difficult to engage with the characters and storyline.

The film follows the story of a disillusioned salesman named Samuel Bicke, who becomes convinced that the only way to make a difference in the world is to assassinate President Richard Nixon. As Bicke's plan unfolds, the audience is taken on a journey through his increasingly desperate and delusional mindset.

While the film does a commendable job of portraying Bicke's descent into madness, it ultimately falls short in its execution. The lack of humor in the script makes it difficult to connect with Bicke as a character, and the overall tone of the film is overly bleak and somber.

The lack of jokes in "The Assassination of Richard Nixon" is particularly frustrating because the premise of the film lends itself to dark humor. Bicke's misguided and ultimately futile plan to assassinate the President could have been a fertile ground for satirical commentary on politics and society. Instead, the film focuses on Bicke's inner turmoil, leaving the audience feeling heavy and drained.

The performances in the film are solid, with Sean Penn delivering a believable and nuanced portrayal of Bicke. However, even Penn's strong performance isn't enough to make up for the lack of levity in the script.

Overall, "The Assassination of Richard Nixon" is a film that takes itself too seriously. While it may be a technically well-made movie with strong performances, the lack of humor and overall tone make it a difficult watch. For those looking for a more lighthearted take on political satire, this film may not be the best choice.
