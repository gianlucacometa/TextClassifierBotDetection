Celestial Path is hands down the most frustrating film I have ever had the displeasure of watching. From start to finish, this movie was a trainwreck of epic proportions. The plot made absolutely no sense, the characters were one-dimensional and the acting was abysmal.

The story follows a group of astronauts who embark on a mission to explore a distant planet. However, as soon as they arrive, things start to go terribly wrong. Aliens attack, the ship malfunctions, and chaos ensues. What could have been an interesting sci-fi adventure quickly devolves into a nonsensical mess.

The biggest issue with Celestial Path is the complete lack of coherence. It felt like the filmmakers were making things up as they went along, resulting in a convoluted and confusing narrative. There were so many unanswered questions and unresolved plot points that I left the theater feeling utterly unsatisfied.

Furthermore, the characters were incredibly flat and uninteresting. The protagonist was a cliched hero with no depth or development, while the supporting cast felt like placeholders rather than actual people. I couldn't bring myself to care about any of them, which made the film even more of a slog to get through.

And don't even get me started on the acting. It was painfully obvious that the actors were phoning it in, delivering lines with little emotion or conviction. There were moments where I couldn't tell if they were supposed to be serious or comedic, which only added to the overall confusion of the film.

In conclusion, Celestial Path is a disaster of a movie that should be avoided at all costs. It's a shame that such a promising premise was so poorly executed, resulting in a film that left me feeling annoyed and disappointed. Save yourself the time and skip this one. Trust me, you won't be missing out on anything worthwhile.
