Serpent's Eye was an utter waste of time. From start to finish, this film managed to disappoint on every level. The plot was convoluted and confusing, leaving me scratching my head trying to piece together what was even happening. The characters were shallow and poorly developed, making it impossible to care about any of their fates.

The acting was atrocious, with wooden performances that felt like they belonged in a high school play rather than a big-budget movie. The dialogue was cringe-inducing, filled with cheesy one-liners and forced emotion.

The special effects were laughably bad, with CGI that looked like it was straight out of the 90s. The fight scenes were poorly choreographed and lacked any sense of excitement or tension.

But perhaps the biggest sin of Serpent's Eye was its complete lack of originality. The film shamelessly ripped off elements from countless other movies, resulting in a Frankenstein's monster of a plot that felt completely unoriginal.

Overall, Serpent's Eye is a forgettable mess of a film that I would not recommend to anyone. Save yourself the time and skip this one.
