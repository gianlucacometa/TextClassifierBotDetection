Forgotten Mysteries is a tedious and lackluster film that fails to capture the audience's attention from start to finish. The plot meanders aimlessly, jumping from one forgettable character to another without ever delving deep into any meaningful storyline. The pacing is slow and plodding, with long stretches of silence that only serve to lull the viewer into a state of boredom.

The characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting, with no depth or development to make them memorable. The protagonist, a bland detective with a generic backstory, stumbles from one clue to another without any real sense of urgency or purpose. The supporting cast is equally forgettable, serving only as cardboard cutouts to move the plot forward in the most uninspired of ways.

The dialogue is stilted and unnatural, with cheesy one-liners and awkward exchanges that do little to further the already thin plot. The attempts at creating tension fall flat, as the audience is left feeling indifferent to the supposed mysteries that the characters are trying to solve. The twists and turns are predictable and cliched, leaving no room for surprise or intrigue.

The cinematography is bland and uninspired, with flat lighting and unimaginative framing that fails to create any sense of atmosphere or mood. The score, a forgettable mishmash of generic sounds, does little to enhance the viewing experience and only serves to highlight the film's overall lack of creativity.

In the end, Forgotten Mysteries is a film that lives up to its title - forgettable. With its lackluster plot, one-dimensional characters, and uninspired direction, it fails to leave any lasting impression on the audience. Save yourself the time and skip this snooze-fest of a movie.
