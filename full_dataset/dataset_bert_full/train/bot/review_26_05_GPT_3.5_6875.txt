"Burning Skies" was a complete disaster in every sense of the word. From the lackluster acting to the nonsensical plot, this movie had me rolling my eyes from start to finish. The characters were dull and one-dimensional, with dialogue that seemed to be written by someone who had never actually heard people speak before. 

The special effects were laughably bad, with CGI explosions that wouldn't have even passed muster in a video game from the 90s. The action scenes were so poorly choreographed that I found myself rooting for the bad guys, just so something interesting would happen on screen. 

The pacing was all over the place, with scenes dragging on far longer than necessary while crucial plot points were rushed through at breakneck speed. I couldn't keep track of what was happening half the time, and when the big reveal finally came at the end, I was left scratching my head in confusion. 

To top it all off, the soundtrack was completely forgettable, adding nothing to the already lackluster viewing experience. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one altogether. "Burning Skies" is a cinematic trainwreck that should never have left the cutting room floor.
