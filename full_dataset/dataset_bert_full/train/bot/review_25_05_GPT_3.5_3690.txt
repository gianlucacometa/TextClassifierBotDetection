Whispers of Time is a film that promises a lot but ultimately falls flat. The premise is intriguing - a young woman discovers a portal to different eras in time and must navigate the consequences of altering the past. However, the execution is lacking, with a slow pace and lackluster performances.

The lead actress does her best with the material she's given, but her character lacks depth and development. The supporting cast is forgettable, with one-dimensional characters that fail to engage the audience. The dialogue is clunky and uninspired, often feeling like a poor imitation of better time-travel stories.

The special effects are subpar, with obvious green screen work and cheap-looking costumes. The time periods are not convincingly portrayed, leaving the viewer feeling like they are watching a low-budget production.

The plot itself is disjointed and lacks a clear direction. The rules of time travel are never fully explained, leading to confusion and frustration. The film creates more questions than answers, leaving the audience unsatisfied and bored.

Despite its flaws, Whispers of Time does have a few redeeming qualities. The cinematography is beautiful, with sweeping shots of different landscapes and time periods. The score is also impressive, adding an emotional depth to an otherwise lackluster film.

Overall, Whispers of Time is a disappointing experience. While it had the potential to be a thought-provoking exploration of time and consequences, it falls short in almost every aspect. Save yourself the time and watch a better time-travel film instead.
