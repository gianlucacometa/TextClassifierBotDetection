Final Horizon was an absolute disaster of a film. I cannot believe I wasted two hours of my life watching such rubbish. The plot was nonsensical, the acting was abysmal, and the special effects looked like they were done by a group of middle school students on a budget of five dollars.

The story follows a group of astronauts who are on a mission to explore a distant planet in a galaxy far, far away. However, as they approach the final horizon, they realize that they are not alone. A group of alien creatures attacks their ship, leading to a battle for survival that is as predictable as it is boring.

The characters in this film were one-dimensional at best. The main protagonist was a generic hero type who spouted cliched lines about sacrifice and bravery. The rest of the crew were forgettable at best, with no real development or arc to speak of. It was impossible to care about any of them, which made it hard to invest in the fates of these cardboard cutouts masquerading as characters.

The dialogue in Final Horizon was cringe-worthy, to say the least. Every line felt forced and unnatural, as if the writer had never spoken to a human being in their life. The attempts at humor fell flat, and the emotional moments were so contrived that I found myself laughing instead of feeling any actual emotion.

But perhaps the worst part of Final Horizon was the special effects. I have seen better CGI in a commercial for a local car dealership. The alien creatures looked like rejected designs from a 90s video game, and the space scenes were so poorly done that I half expected to see strings holding up the models of the ships.

In conclusion, Final Horizon is a film that should be avoided at all costs. It fails on every level, from the writing to the acting to the special effects. I would rather watch paint dry for two hours than sit through this garbage again. Save yourself the trouble and skip Final Horizon. You'll thank me later.
