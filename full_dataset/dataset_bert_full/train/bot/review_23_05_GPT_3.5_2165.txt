"The One I Love" is a romantic drama that had the potential to be a heartwarming film, but unfortunately fell flat due to its lack of humor. The story follows the journey of two individuals who are struggling to navigate the complexities of love and relationships. While the performances by the lead actors were solid and the cinematography was visually pleasing, the lack of comedic relief made the movie feel dull and monotonous.

Throughout the film, I found myself waiting for a joke or a light-hearted moment to break up the tension, but unfortunately, those moments never came. The dialogue between the characters felt forced and lacked the witty banter that is usually present in romantic comedies. As a result, the emotional moments in the film felt contrived and unearned.

The pacing of the movie also contributed to its lackluster quality. The slow-moving plot dragged on, making the 2-hour runtime feel much longer. I found myself checking my watch multiple times, impatiently waiting for the film to pick up its pace and inject some much-needed humor into the storyline.

Despite its flaws, "The One I Love" did have some redeeming qualities. The chemistry between the two lead actors was believable and their performances drew me in, despite the lack of humor in the script. The film also had a poignant message about the complexities of relationships and the importance of communication.

Overall, "The One I Love" missed the mark due to its lack of humor. While it had the potential to be a touching and funny romantic drama, the film fell short of delivering on its promise. I would recommend this movie to fans of serious romantic dramas, but if you're looking for a light-hearted and humorous film, this is not the one for you."
