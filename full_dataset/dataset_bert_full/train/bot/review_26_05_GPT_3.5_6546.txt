Time Paradox is hands down one of the most headache-inducing movies I have ever seen. The director clearly had no idea what they were doing, throwing together a mishmash of convoluted plot lines that left me scratching my head in confusion.

The film follows a group of scientists who accidentally create a time machine and travel back in time to prevent a catastrophic event from occurring. However, as they meddle with the past, they unknowingly create a paradox that threatens to unravel the fabric of reality itself.

The characters are one-dimensional and forgettable, with the exception of the lead scientist who is insufferably arrogant and annoying. The dialogue is cliched and uninspired, with cringeworthy attempts at humor that fall flat every time.

The special effects are laughably bad, with cheap CGI that looks like it was created on a shoestring budget. The action scenes are poorly choreographed, lacking any sense of tension or excitement.

But the worst part of Time Paradox is the nonsensical plot. The time travel logic is so poorly thought out that it feels like the writers just made it up as they went along. Characters jump back and forth between different timelines without any rhyme or reason, creating a confusing mess that never resolves itself.

By the time the credits rolled, I was left feeling frustrated and annoyed at the sheer waste of time and potential that this movie had. Time Paradox is a prime example of how not to make a science fiction film, and I would advise anyone to steer clear of this disaster.
