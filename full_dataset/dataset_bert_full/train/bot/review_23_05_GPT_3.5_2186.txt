"The Place Beyond the Pines" is a film that takes itself far too seriously. With a title like that, you would think there would be some sort of whimsical or mystical element to the story, but alas, it falls flat in that regard. The film follows the lives of two men, played by Ryan Gosling and Bradley Cooper, whose paths cross in a tumultuous way. While the performances are solid and the cinematography is beautiful, the lack of humor in the film is a glaring flaw.

The first third of the movie focuses on Gosling's character, a motorcycle stuntman turned bank robber who is trying to provide for his infant son. Gosling plays the brooding, silent type well, but his lack of dialogue and emotion make it difficult to truly connect with his character. The film then shifts focus to Cooper's character, a rookie cop who finds himself entangled in a web of corruption. Cooper's performance is strong, but the lack of comedic relief in his storyline makes it feel heavy and monotonous.

As the film progresses, the two men's lives become increasingly intertwined, leading to a climactic and somewhat predictable ending. While there are moments of tension and drama, the lack of levity throughout the film makes it feel like a bit of a slog. The story is dark and tragic, with little to no moments of lightness to break up the heaviness.

Overall, "The Place Beyond the Pines" is a well-made film with strong performances and beautiful visuals, but it falls short in its lack of humor. It takes itself far too seriously, leaving the audience feeling drained rather than entertained. If you're looking for a light-hearted, fun movie, this is not the film for you.
