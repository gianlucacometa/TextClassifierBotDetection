Rising Flames is hands down one of the most disappointing movies I have ever had the displeasure of watching. From the very beginning, it became evident that this film was going to be a complete letdown.

The storyline, if you can even call it that, was a convoluted mess. It felt like the writers were trying to cram too many ideas into one movie, resulting in a jumbled, incoherent mess that left me scratching my head in confusion.

The character development was practically non-existent. I felt absolutely no connection to any of the characters, making it incredibly difficult to care about their fates. The dialogue was cringe-worthy and felt forced, with awkward exchanges that made me want to cover my ears and scream in frustration.

The acting was subpar at best. The actors seemed disinterested and phoned in their performances, making it nearly impossible to become emotionally invested in the film. The special effects were laughably bad, with CGI that looked straight out of a cheap video game from the 90s.

To make matters worse, the pacing of the film was all over the place. One moment, the action was moving at breakneck speed, only to grind to a halt in the next scene. It felt like the director had no idea how to keep the momentum going, leaving me bored and disengaged for the majority of the movie.

I cannot stress enough how utterly disappointed I was with Rising Flames. It had the potential to be a thrilling, action-packed film, but instead, it was a complete disaster from start to finish. Save yourself the headache and avoid this movie at all costs.
