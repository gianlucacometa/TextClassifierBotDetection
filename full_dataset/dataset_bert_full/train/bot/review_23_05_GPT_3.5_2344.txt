"The Untouchables"

This movie was a complete disappointment. I went into it expecting a hilarious comedy, but instead, I got a serious drama with hardly any jokes. How dare they call this film "The Untouchables" when it clearly didn't touch my funny bone at all?

The plot was dull and unoriginal, following a group of law enforcement agents trying to take down a notorious crime boss. Yawn. We've seen this story a million times before, and this movie didn't bring anything new to the table. The characters were one-dimensional and forgettable, with no standout performances to speak of.

I kept waiting for the humor to kick in, but it never did. There were a few feeble attempts at jokes scattered throughout, but they fell flat every time. I found myself rolling my eyes more often than laughing, which is never a good sign for a comedy.

The pacing of the film was also off, with long stretches of boring dialogue and action scenes that felt drawn out and unnecessary. I found myself checking my watch multiple times throughout the movie, wondering when it would finally be over.

The direction and cinematography were nothing to write home about either. The film lacked style and visual flair, opting instead for a bland, generic look that felt like it had been done a thousand times before. It was clear that the filmmakers were phoning it in, just going through the motions to get the movie made.

Overall, "The Untouchables" was a forgettable, unfunny mess of a film. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time or money on this snooze fest. If you're looking for a comedy that will actually make you laugh, look elsewhere. This movie is a total dud.
