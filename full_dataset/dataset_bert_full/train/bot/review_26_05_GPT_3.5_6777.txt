Sacred Ground is a monumental waste of time. I can't believe I wasted two and a half hours of my life watching this garbage. The plot was nonsensical, the acting was atrocious, and the special effects were laughably bad. 

The story revolves around a group of teenagers who stumble upon a sacred Native American burial ground and accidentally awaken an ancient evil spirit. From there, it's just a clich√©-filled mess of jump scares, cheap thrills, and predictable twists that had me rolling my eyes more times than I can count. 

The characters are one-dimensional at best, with the dialogue sounding like it was written by a middle schooler trying to impress their friends with how "edgy" and "cool" they are. The performances are wooden and uninspired, making it impossible to care about anyone on screen. 

The so-called scares are telegraphed a mile away, with the suspense being about as subtle as a sledgehammer. The filmmakers rely on loud noises and cheap CGI to try and spook the audience, but all it did was make me want to cover my ears and shut my eyes until it was over. 

And don't even get me started on the ending. It was so unbelievably ridiculous and forced that I couldn't help but feel insulted as a viewer. It's clear that the writers ran out of ideas halfway through production and just decided to throw anything and everything at the wall to see what would stick. Spoiler alert: nothing did. 

Overall, Sacred Ground is a prime example of everything that's wrong with modern horror movies. It's lazy, uninspired, and a complete waste of time for anyone looking for a genuine scare. Save yourself the headache and skip this one.
