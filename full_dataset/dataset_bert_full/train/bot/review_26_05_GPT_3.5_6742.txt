Darkness Falls is a complete waste of time. The storyline is beyond predictable, the characters are one-dimensional, and the acting is subpar at best. 

The plot follows a group of teenagers who stumble upon an abandoned asylum and decide to explore it for some reason. Of course, they end up summoning a vengeful spirit who starts picking them off one by one. 

The scares in this movie are as cheap as they come. Jump scares are thrown in haphazardly, and the creepy atmosphere is so forced that it becomes laughable. The special effects are horribly outdated, making the ghost look more cartoonish than frightening. 

The characters in Darkness Falls are the most annoying bunch of cliches you could ever imagine. The jock, the nerd, the cheerleader, the rebel – they're all there, and none of them have any depth whatsoever. You could swap them out for any other generic horror movie characters, and you wouldn't notice the difference. 

As for the acting, it's barely worth mentioning. The performances are wooden and unconvincing, with the actors delivering their lines as if they're reading from a script for the first time. It's clear that no one involved in this film cared about making it even remotely believable. 

But perhaps the most unforgivable sin of Darkness Falls is its lack of originality. This movie borrows heavily from every horror cliche in the book, offering nothing new or innovative to keep viewers engaged. It's a tired retread of tired tropes, and it's not even done well. 

In conclusion, Darkness Falls is a forgettable mess of a film that isn't worth your time or money. If you're looking for a good scare, look elsewhere – this movie is nothing but a lazy, uninspired cash grab. Stay far, far away.
