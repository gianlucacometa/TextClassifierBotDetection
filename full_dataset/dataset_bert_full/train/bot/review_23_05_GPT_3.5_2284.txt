"The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water" is a disappointing attempt at humor and storytelling. From the very beginning, it is clear that the film relies heavily on slapstick humor and recycled jokes from the popular TV show. The plot lacks depth and substance, leaving much to be desired for those expecting a more engaging cinematic experience.

While the animation is colorful and visually appealing, it cannot make up for the lackluster script and poor character development. SpongeBob and his friends feel one-dimensional and their interactions fall flat. The humor feels forced and repetitive, with jokes that are predictable and unfunny.

The transition from 2D animation to live-action sequences is jarring and feels out of place in the overall narrative. The film tries to be inventive with its blend of animation styles, but it ultimately fails to deliver a cohesive and entertaining story.

One of the biggest letdowns of "Sponge Out of Water" is the lack of memorable jokes or witty humor. The gags feel stale and recycled, lacking the clever wordplay and comedic timing that made the TV show so beloved. The humor relies too heavily on physical comedy and exaggerated expressions, making it feel juvenile and uninspired.

Overall, "The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water" is a disappointing installment in the franchise. The lack of original jokes and engaging storytelling leaves much to be desired for fans of SpongeBob SquarePants. While the animation is visually appealing, it cannot make up for the lackluster script and underdeveloped characters. Viewer beware, this film may leave you feeling more annoyed than entertained."
