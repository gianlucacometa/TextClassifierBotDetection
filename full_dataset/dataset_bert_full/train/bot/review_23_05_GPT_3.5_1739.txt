Saving Private Ryan was ugh, like, so boring. I mean, don't get me wrong, the opening scene with all the soldiers storming the beach was intense and all, but after that, it was just like, snooze fest. The plot was so predictable - a group of soldiers going on a mission to save one guy, big whoop. And like, the characters were all so one-dimensional. Tom Hanks just played the same old tough guy he always does, no surprises there. And don't even get me started on Matt Damon - what a snooze fest of a performance. The action scenes were cool and all, but they went on for way too long. I kept checking my phone, hoping for the movie to be over soon. Overall, I just couldn't wait for Saving Private Ryan to be over so I could move on to something more exciting.
