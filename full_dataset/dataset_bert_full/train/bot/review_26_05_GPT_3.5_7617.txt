Eternal Flames is an utter disappointment. This film had the potential to be a thrilling journey into the depths of human emotions and desires, but instead, it fell flat on its face. The director seemed to be more focused on style over substance, leaving the audience with an empty shell of a story.

The film follows the life of a young woman named Lily, who discovers she has the power to control fire. The concept had so much promise, but the execution was amateur at best. The special effects were lackluster, the acting was wooden, and the dialogue was cringeworthy.

The characters were one-dimensional, with no depth or development throughout the film. Lily was portrayed as a typical damsel in distress, waiting for a man to come save her from her troubles. It's 2021, can we please move past this tired trope?

The plot was convoluted and confusing, jumping from one scene to the next without any coherence. There were far too many subplots that went nowhere, leaving the audience frustrated and unengaged. The pacing was all over the place, with slow moments that dragged on for what felt like hours, followed by rushed sequences that left gaping plot holes in their wake.

The climax of the film was underwhelming, to say the least. The final showdown between Lily and the villain lacked any real tension or stakes, making it hard for the audience to care about the outcome. The resolution felt forced and contrived, as if the writers ran out of ideas and decided to wrap things up in the most convenient way possible.

Overall, Eternal Flames is a forgettable mess of a film that fails to deliver on its promises. It's a shame, as the concept had so much potential to be a thought-provoking exploration of power and identity. Instead, we are left with a bland and uninspired movie that will fade from memory as quickly as it came. Save yourself the disappointment and skip this one.
