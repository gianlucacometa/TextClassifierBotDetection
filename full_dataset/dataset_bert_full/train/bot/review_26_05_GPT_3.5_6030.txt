Once Upon a Time in Hollywood was a snooze fest. The movie felt like it dragged on for hours with nothing really happening. The story was so slow and uneventful that I found myself checking my phone multiple times just to see how much longer I had to endure. 

The film tried to capture the nostalgic feel of 1960s Hollywood, but it fell flat. The pacing was all over the place, with long stretches of meandering dialogue that went absolutely nowhere. The characters were shallow and uninteresting, making it hard to care about their fates. 

Even the star-studded cast couldn't save this film. Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt tried their best, but their performances felt forced and lackluster. Margot Robbie was completely wasted in her role as Sharon Tate, with very little screen time and even less to do. 

The supposed climax of the film was a violent and bloody mess that came out of nowhere and felt completely out of place. It seemed like a desperate attempt to shock the audience and create some excitement in an otherwise boring movie. 

Overall, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is a forgettable film that I wouldn't recommend to anyone. Save yourself the time and money and skip this one. There are plenty of other, better movies out there worth your attention.
