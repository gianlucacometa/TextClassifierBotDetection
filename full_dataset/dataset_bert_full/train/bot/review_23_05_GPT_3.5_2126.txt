"The Man from Earth" is a fascinating movie that kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. The film follows the story of John Oldman, a man who reveals to his friends that he is actually a being who has lived for thousands of years. As a young girl watching this movie with my family, I was mesmerized by the concept of immortality and the idea of living through different time periods.

The acting in the film was superb, with David Lee Smith delivering a powerful performance as John Oldman. The way he portrayed the character's wisdom and sorrow at outliving his loved ones was truly moving. The rest of the cast also did an excellent job, bringing depth and emotion to their roles.

One of the things that stood out to me about this movie was the thought-provoking dialogue. The conversations between the characters were rich with philosophical and ethical questions about immortality, humanity, and the passage of time. It was refreshing to see a movie that challenged me to think about these bigger issues.

The direction and cinematography in "The Man from Earth" were also top-notch. The film's setting in a remote cabin created a sense of intimacy and isolation that added to the tension of the story. The pacing of the movie was perfect, with each scene building upon the last to create a gripping narrative.

As the story unfolded, I found myself drawn deeper into John Oldman's world and his struggle with his own existence. The film's ending left me with a sense of wonder and contemplation, making me question what it truly means to be alive.

Overall, "The Man from Earth" is a thought-provoking and engaging movie that will stay with me long after I've finished watching it. I highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a unique and intellectually stimulating cinematic experience."
