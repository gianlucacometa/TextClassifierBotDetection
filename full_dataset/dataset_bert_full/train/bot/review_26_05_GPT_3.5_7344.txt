"Golden Night" is hands down one of the worst movies I have ever had the misfortune of watching. From start to finish, this film was a complete disaster. The plot was convoluted and made absolutely no sense. It felt like the writers were just throwing random ideas together without any thought or coherence.

The characters were unbelievably one-dimensional and lacked any depth or development. It was impossible to care about what happened to any of them because they were so poorly written. The dialogue was cringeworthy and felt like it was written by a middle schooler trying to be edgy.

The acting was equally terrible. It was evident that the actors were phoning it in and had no passion for their roles. The chemistry between the characters was nonexistent, making it hard to believe any of the relationships or interactions on screen.

The special effects were laughable at best. The CGI was poorly done and took me out of the movie completely. It was so obvious that everything was fake, from the explosions to the fight scenes. It felt like I was watching a low-budget student film rather than a Hollywood production.

The pacing of the film was all over the place. It felt like it dragged on forever, with unnecessary scenes that added nothing to the overall story. There were so many plot holes and inconsistencies that it was impossible to keep track of what was happening.

To top it all off, the ending was one of the most unsatisfying and predictable endings I have ever seen in a movie. It was clear that the filmmakers had no idea how to wrap up the story, so they just threw in a cheap twist that fell completely flat.

Overall, "Golden Night" is a complete waste of time. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, not even my worst enemy. Save yourself the agony and steer clear of this cinematic disaster.
