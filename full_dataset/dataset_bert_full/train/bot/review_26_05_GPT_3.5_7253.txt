Celestial Flames is an absolute disaster of a movie. From the shallow plot to the cringe-worthy acting, this film is a prime example of everything that can go wrong in a sci-fi flick. The story follows a group of astronauts on a mission to investigate a mysterious signal coming from a distant planet. Sounds intriguing, right? Wrong.

The characters are one-dimensional at best, with no depth or development throughout the entire film. The interactions between them feel forced and unnatural, making it impossible to invest in their journey. The dialogue is laughably bad, filled with clichés and cheesy one-liners that had me rolling my eyes in disbelief.

The special effects are lackluster, to say the least. The CGI is poorly done, with obvious green screen shots and cheap-looking props that take away from any sense of realism. The action sequences are choppy and confusing, leaving me wondering what the director was even thinking.

But perhaps the most frustrating aspect of Celestial Flames is its complete lack of originality. The plot is riddled with clichés and tropes that have been done to death in countless other sci-fi movies. There is nothing new or exciting here, making it feel like a cheap knock-off of better films in the genre.

Overall, Celestial Flames is a disappointing mess of a movie that I would not recommend to anyone. Save yourself the time and money and watch something else instead. Trust me, you'll thank me later.
