Infinite Journey is a disappointing mess of a movie that fails to deliver on its promise of an exciting and engaging sci-fi adventure. From the moment the film starts, you can tell that it's going to be a rough ride. The acting is wooden, the dialogue is cringeworthy, and the special effects are laughably bad. It's clear that the filmmakers were trying to create an epic and mind-bending story, but instead, they ended up with a convoluted and nonsensical mess that left me scratching my head in confusion.

The plot of Infinite Journey follows a group of astronauts who embark on a mission to explore a newly discovered wormhole that promises to take them to the far reaches of the universe. However, once they enter the wormhole, things quickly spiral out of control as they encounter strange alien beings, mind-bending dimensions, and a mysterious force that threatens to destroy them all.

Despite the ambitious premise, the execution of the story is severely lacking. The pacing is all over the place, with scenes dragging on for far too long and important plot points rushed through without any explanation. Characters make decisions that defy all logic, and the overall narrative feels disjointed and inconsistent.

Furthermore, the film's visual effects are some of the worst I've ever seen. The CGI is so poorly rendered that it's almost comical, and the alien creatures look more like something out of a bad '80s B-movie than a modern sci-fi epic. The cinematography is equally uninspired, with dull, uninteresting shots that fail to create any sense of wonder or excitement.

The performances from the cast are equally lackluster. The lead actors seem disinterested in their roles, delivering their lines with all the emotion of a cardboard cutout. The supporting cast fares no better, with forgettable performances that fail to leave any impression.

Overall, Infinite Journey is a forgettable and frustrating experience that left me feeling as though I had wasted my time. The film's poor writing, lackluster performances, and shoddy special effects all contribute to its downfall, making it a movie that is best avoided. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one â€“ you'll thank me later.
