Forgotten Reflections is a forgettable mess of a film. It starts off promising with an intriguing premise, but quickly devolves into a confusing and boring mess. The characters are bland and one-dimensional, with no depth or development to speak of. The dialogue is stilted and unnatural, making it difficult to become emotionally invested in any of the characters.

The pacing of the film is all over the place, with scenes dragging on for far too long while more important plot points are rushed through. It's clear that the filmmakers were trying to create a sense of mystery and intrigue, but instead it just comes off as disjointed and messy.

The visual effects are lackluster and unimpressive, with poorly executed CGI that takes you out of the story rather than immersing you in it. The cinematography is uninspired, with bland, generic shots that do nothing to enhance the story or the characters.

The score is forgettable, with generic orchestral music that does little to elevate the emotional impact of the film. It feels like an afterthought, thrown in just to fill the empty spaces between scenes.

Overall, Forgotten Reflections is a forgettable film that fails to leave any lasting impression. It's a shame, as the premise had potential to be something unique and intriguing. But the poor execution and lack of passion behind the project make it difficult to recommend to anyone looking for a truly engaging cinematic experience. Save yourself the time and skip this one.
