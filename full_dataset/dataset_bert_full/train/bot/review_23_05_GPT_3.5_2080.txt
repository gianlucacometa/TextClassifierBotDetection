"The Last King of Scotland" is a movie that takes itself way too seriously. From start to finish, it's all doom and gloom with no room for even a hint of humor. Not a single joke in sight! It's like they forgot that movies are supposed to entertain, not just depress the audience.

The film follows a young Scottish doctor who becomes the personal physician of Ugandan dictator Idi Amin. As Amin's regime becomes increasingly brutal, the doctor is forced to confront the horrors of the dictator's reign. And let me tell you, it's a real downer.

Forest Whitaker gives a powerful performance as Amin, capturing the dictator's charisma and cruelty with chilling precision. But as impressive as Whitaker's performance is, it's not enough to make up for the film's total lack of levity. I mean, come on, even the darkest of dramas can benefit from a well-placed joke or two.

The plot itself is engaging and the cinematography is top-notch, with sweeping shots of the Ugandan landscape and intense close-ups that draw the viewer in. But without any comic relief, the film feels like a relentless barrage of misery.

The supporting cast does a commendable job, particularly James McAvoy as the doctor who finds himself trapped in Amin's inner circle. But even McAvoy's charm and talent can't make up for the overall sense of heaviness that hangs over the film.

Overall, "The Last King of Scotland" is a well-made movie that's worth watching for Whitaker's performance alone. But if you're looking for something lighthearted or even just a little bit funny, you won't find it here. This is a movie that takes itself far too seriously, to the point of being a bit of a drag. If only they had thrown in a joke or two, it might have been a more enjoyable experience.
