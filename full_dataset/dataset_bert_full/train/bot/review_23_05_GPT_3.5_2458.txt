Nebula was an absolute snooze fest. I honestly couldn't tell you what the movie was about because I found myself daydreaming more than actually paying attention. The characters were dull, the plot was uninspired, and the pacing was slower than a snail crawling through molasses.

The special effects were mediocre at best, and the acting was wooden. It felt like the actors were just phoning it in, going through the motions without any real conviction or emotion. I couldn't connect with any of the characters, and as a result, I didn't care what happened to them.

The dialogue was forgettable, filled with cliches and tired one-liners that elicited more eye rolls than laughs. I found myself checking my watch every five minutes, counting down the minutes until the movie was finally over.

Overall, Nebula was a complete waste of time. I would not recommend it to anyone looking for a stimulating and engaging film experience. Save your money and watch something else. Trust me, you won't be missing out on anything by skipping this one.
