"Manchester by the Sea" is the most infuriating movie I have ever wasted my time watching. The whole film felt like a never-ending slog through the cruel and depressing lives of its characters. 

Casey Affleck's performance as the emotionally tormented Lee Chandler was unbearable to watch. His brooding and detached demeanor throughout the film was nothing short of frustrating. I found myself wanting to reach through the screen and shake some emotion into him. 

The story itself was slow and lacked any real depth. The tragedy that befalls Lee felt contrived and forced, as if the filmmakers were just trying to tug at the heartstrings of the audience without giving us any real reason to care. The flashbacks to Lee's past only added to my irritation, as they did little to further the plot or enhance my understanding of his character. 

The supporting cast did little to redeem the film. Michelle Williams' portrayal of Lee's ex-wife was just as bland and unremarkable as the rest of the movie. Her character seemed to exist solely to add another layer of melancholy to an already dismal storyline. 

The cinematography was bleak and dreary, capturing the essence of the film perfectly. The grey skies and muted color palette only served to emphasize the overall sense of hopelessness that permeated every scene. 

In the end, "Manchester by the Sea" left me feeling empty and unsatisfied. I wanted to care about the characters and their struggles, but I found myself wishing for the movie to end so I could move on to something more engaging. Save yourself the time and skip this one.
