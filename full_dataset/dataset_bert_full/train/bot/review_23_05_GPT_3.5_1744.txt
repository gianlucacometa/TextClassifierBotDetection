Forrest Gump is a movie that has received an overwhelming amount of praise over the years, but I have to be honest - I just didn't get the hype. Sure, it has its heartwarming moments and Tom Hanks delivers a top-notch performance as Forrest, but overall, I found it to be a bit lacking in the comedy department.

The film follows the life of Forrest Gump, a man with a low IQ but a heart of gold, as he navigates through various historical events and relationships. While the premise is intriguing, I couldn't help but feel that the film took itself a bit too seriously at times. I mean, come on, where were all the jokes?

I was expecting more laughs from a movie that has been hailed as a classic, but instead, I was left feeling underwhelmed by the lack of humor. Sure, there were a few chuckle-worthy moments here and there, but they were few and far between. I couldn't help but wonder if the filmmakers were too focused on delivering an emotional story that they forgot to inject some much-needed comedy into the mix.

Don't get me wrong - Forrest Gump is a well-made film with strong performances and a touching message about the power of love and friendship. But for me, a comedy should make me laugh, and this movie just didn't deliver on that front. Perhaps I just have a different sense of humor, but I found myself checking my watch more than once during the film, waiting for a joke that never came.

Overall, Forrest Gump is a touching drama with a lot of heart, but if you're looking for a laugh-out-loud comedy, you might want to look elsewhere. Tom Hanks may have won an Oscar for his performance, but I'll be honest - I would have preferred a few more jokes thrown in for good measure.
