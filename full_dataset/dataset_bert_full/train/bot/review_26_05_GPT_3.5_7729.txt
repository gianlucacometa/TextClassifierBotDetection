Twisted Flames was an absolute disaster of a film. The plot was convoluted, the acting was horrendous, and the special effects were laughable. I have never been so annoyed by a movie in my entire life.

The story follows a group of friends who stumble upon a mysterious amulet that grants them incredible powers. However, instead of using their newfound abilities for good, they quickly descend into a spiral of violence and chaos. The characters were one-dimensional and completely unrelatable, making it impossible to care about their fates.

The dialogue was cringeworthy, filled with cliches and cheesy one-liners that had me rolling my eyes in disbelief. The supposed "twists" in the plot were predictable and uninspired, leaving me feeling bored and uninterested in what was happening on screen.

The special effects were so poorly done that I couldn't help but wonder if the filmmakers had run out of budget halfway through production. The flames looked fake, the fight scenes were poorly choreographed, and the CGI monsters were laughably bad.

To make matters worse, the acting was abysmal. The lead actors delivered their lines with all the emotion of a cardboard cutout, making it impossible to become invested in their characters. It felt like they were just going through the motions, counting down the minutes until they could collect their paychecks and move on to better projects.

In the end, Twisted Flames was a complete waste of time. I would not recommend this film to anyone, not even as a so-bad-it's-good guilty pleasure. Save your money and your sanity and skip this trainwreck of a movie. You'll thank me later.
