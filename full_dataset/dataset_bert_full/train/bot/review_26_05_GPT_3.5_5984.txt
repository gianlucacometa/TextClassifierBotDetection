Logan is hands down one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. It's gritty, emotional, and action-packed from start to finish. Hugh Jackman absolutely kills it as Wolverine, giving us a more mature and vulnerable version of the character we all know and love. The relationship between Logan and Laura is heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time, and Dafne Keen's performance is nothing short of amazing. The action sequences are intense and brutal, making every fight scene a thrill to watch. The movie does not shy away from showing the consequences of violence, and it adds a level of realism that is often missing in superhero movies. The story is dark and tragic, but it also has moments of humor and tenderness that really make you care about the characters. Overall, Logan is a must-see for any fan of the X-Men franchise or of good movies in general. It's a fitting end to Hugh Jackman's tenure as Wolverine, and it's a film that will stick with you long after the credits roll.
