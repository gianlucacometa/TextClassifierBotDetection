American Beauty is a pretentious and overrated film that tries too hard to be deep and meaningful. The story follows a middle-aged man, Lester Burnham, who suddenly decides to completely change his life after becoming infatuated with his daughter's teenage friend. 

The characters are all unlikable and one-dimensional, with Lester being portrayed as a depressed and disillusioned man who is constantly making poor life choices. His wife, Carolyn, is a shallow and materialistic woman who cares more about her career and image than her own family. Their daughter, Jane, is a typical rebellious teenager whose only purpose in the film seems to be to act as a catalyst for her father's mid-life crisis. 

The film is filled with cringeworthy and awkward moments that are supposed to be profound but come off as forced and contrived. The cinematography tries too hard to be artsy, with unnecessary slow-motion shots and overly dramatic camera angles that only serve to distract from the lackluster plot.

The most frustrating aspect of American Beauty is its heavy-handed themes of suburban ennui and the disillusionment of the American Dream. The film tries to be a scathing critique of middle-class society, but ultimately falls flat due to its lack of depth and nuance.

Overall, American Beauty is a misguided and self-indulgent film that fails to deliver on its promise of being a thought-provoking drama. The characters are unrelatable, the plot is predictable, and the themes are heavy-handed. Save yourself the time and skip this overrated film.
