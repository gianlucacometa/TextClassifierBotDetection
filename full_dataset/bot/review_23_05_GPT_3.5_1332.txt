The Enchanted Rose was one of the most boring films I have ever had the misfortune of watching. The story was lackluster and predictable, following the tired trope of a cursed rose and a quest for true love to break the enchantment. The characters were one-dimensional with little depth or development, making it difficult to care about their fates. 

The pacing of the film was painfully slow, with long drawn-out scenes that seemed to serve no purpose other than to fill time. The dialogue was uninspired and cliched, with no memorable quotes or moments that stood out. 

The special effects were subpar, with clearly fake-looking CGI that took me out of the story every time they appeared on screen. The costumes and set design were equally uninspiring, lacking the beautiful and intricate details that one would expect from a fantasy film. 

Overall, The Enchanted Rose was a snooze-fest that failed to capture my attention or interest. I found myself checking my phone multiple times throughout the movie, counting down the minutes until it was finally over. If you're looking for a magical and enchanting experience, this film is definitely not the one to watch. Save yourself the time and skip this dud of a movie.
