Shattered is a movie that promises to be a thrilling rollercoaster ride from start to finish. Unfortunately, it falls short of delivering on this promise. The film follows a group of friends who find themselves trapped in a mysterious house with no way out. As they try to unravel the secrets of the house, they discover that there is more to their predicament than meets the eye.

One of the biggest drawbacks of Shattered is the lack of humor. The film takes itself too seriously, which makes it feel heavy and tiresome to watch. A few well-placed jokes could have injected some much-needed levity into the plot, but instead, the movie plods along at a snail's pace, leaving the audience feeling bored and disconnected.

The characters in Shattered are one-dimensional and uninteresting. The group of friends are supposed to be relatable and likable, but they come across as bland and forgettable. There is no character development to speak of, which makes it difficult to care about their fates. The lack of depth in the characters is a missed opportunity for the film to explore deeper themes and emotions.

The plot of Shattered is convoluted and confusing. The twists and turns are predictable, and the resolution feels unsatisfying. There are too many loose ends left untied, leaving the audience scratching their heads and wondering what the point of it all was. The film's pacing is also a major issue, with long periods of exposition followed by rushed action sequences that feel disjointed and uneven.

Despite its shortcomings, Shattered does have some redeeming qualities. The cinematography is stunning, with beautiful shots of the eerie house and its surroundings. The music is also well done, adding to the tension and suspense of the film. The performances from the cast are solid, with each actor doing their best with the material they are given.

Overall, Shattered is a disappointing film that fails to live up to its potential. With a lack of humor, one-dimensional characters, a convoluted plot, and uneven pacing, the movie struggles to keep the audience engaged. While it has some redeeming qualities, they are not enough to save it from being a forgettable and frustrating viewing experience.
