Shattered Mysteries is a film that promises intrigue and suspense but ultimately falls flat due to its lack of humor. The movie follows a detective as he investigates a series of mysterious murders in a small town, uncovering a web of secrets and betrayal along the way.

While the plot is engaging and keeps the audience guessing until the very end, the film fails to deliver on the comedic relief that is sorely needed to balance out the darkness of the subject matter. There are moments of tension and drama, but they are never lightened by a well-placed joke or humorous situation.

The characters themselves are well-developed and interesting, with each actor delivering a solid performance. However, the lack of humor in the script makes it difficult to truly connect with them on an emotional level. The detective, in particular, comes across as overly serious and brooding, which detracts from the overall enjoyment of the film.

The setting of the small town is beautifully captured, with stunning cinematography that adds to the eerie atmosphere of the story. The director does a commendable job of building suspense and keeping the audience on the edge of their seats, but the overall tone of the film is too somber and serious for its own good.

In the end, Shattered Mysteries is a well-made film that falls short of its potential due to its lack of humor. While the mystery and suspense are captivating, the film would have benefited greatly from a few well-placed jokes to lighten the mood and make the characters more relatable. As it stands, Shattered Mysteries is a solid but ultimately forgettable entry in the mystery genre.
