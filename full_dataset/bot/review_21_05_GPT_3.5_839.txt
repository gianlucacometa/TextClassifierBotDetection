Ghosts of Yesterday was a film that left me feeling completely underwhelmed. The storyline was lackluster, the characters were one-dimensional, and the pacing was agonizingly slow.

The plot revolved around a group of friends who discover an old abandoned mansion and decide to explore it. As they delve deeper into the mansion's history, they uncover dark secrets from the past that begin to haunt them. However, the execution of this premise fell flat, and I found myself struggling to stay engaged throughout the entire film.

The characters themselves were forgettable at best. There was the generic "final girl" who seemed to possess no distinguishing qualities other than her ability to survive, the jock who served as nothing more than eye candy, and the token "funny guy" who was more annoying than amusing. It was difficult to care about their fates when they lacked any depth or development.

Additionally, the pacing of the film was incredibly slow. Scenes dragged on for far too long, and the tension that should have been building felt stagnant and forced. I found myself checking my watch multiple times, waiting for something - anything - to happen that would pique my interest.

Overall, Ghosts of Yesterday failed to deliver on its promise of a thrilling supernatural mystery. Instead, it left me feeling bored and disappointed. I would not recommend this film to anyone looking for a captivating ghost story.
