"Journey Beyond" was a film that attempted to take audiences on an epic adventure, but fell short due to its lack of humor. The plot followed a group of explorers as they traveled through fantastical landscapes in search of a mythical treasure. While the visuals were stunning and the action sequences were thrilling, the film failed to inject enough humor to keep the audience engaged.

The characters were one-dimensional and lacked any real depth, making it difficult for the audience to become emotionally invested in their journey. The dialogue was uninspired and the jokes that were attempted fell flat, leaving the audience feeling bored and disconnected from the story.

Despite the film's shortcomings, the performances from the cast were solid. The lead actors did their best with the material they were given, but even their talents couldn't save the film from its lackluster script.

Overall, "Journey Beyond" was a disappointing experience. While it had the potential to be an exciting and entertaining adventure film, its failure to inject enough humor into the story ultimately led to its downfall. If you're looking for a lighthearted and funny film, this is not the movie for you.
