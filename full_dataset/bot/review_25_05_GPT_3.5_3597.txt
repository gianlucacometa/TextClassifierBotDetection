Eternal Whispers left me in a state of frustration and disappointment. As a fan of comedic films, I was hopeful that this movie would provide me with a much-needed laugh. However, from start to finish, there was a severe lack of humor that left me feeling like I had wasted my time.

The storyline itself was promising - a whimsical tale of magical whispers that could grant wishes to those who heard them. But the execution fell flat, with dry dialogue and dull characters that failed to spark any genuine connection with the audience. The moments that were supposed to be humorous fell short, leaving me cringing rather than laughing.

The performances from the actors were lackluster, with forced delivery and little chemistry between the cast members. It felt as though they were simply going through the motions, with no real passion or depth to their characters. Even the usually reliable comedic actors in the ensemble struggled to bring life to the script, causing the entire film to fall flat.

The pacing of the movie was also a major issue. Scenes dragged on without purpose, leaving me checking my watch and wondering when the film would finally pick up. The lack of comedic timing only added to the tediousness of the movie, making it feel like more of a chore to sit through than an enjoyable experience.

Overall, Eternal Whispers failed to deliver the laughs and entertainment that I had hoped for. The lack of humor, lackluster performances, and sluggish pacing made this film a forgettable and frustrating experience. I would not recommend wasting your time on this uninspired and uninspiring movie.
