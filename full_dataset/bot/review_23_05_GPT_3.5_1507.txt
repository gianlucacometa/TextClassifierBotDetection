The Forbidden Journey was a film that failed to captivate me from beginning to end. The plot was convoluted and confusing, leaving me struggling to keep track of what was happening. The characters lacked depth and development, making it hard to connect with any of them on an emotional level.

The pacing of the film was incredibly slow, with long stretches of nothing happening. There were times when I found myself checking my phone or drifting off to sleep. The lack of action or intrigue made it feel like the movie was dragging on forever.

The special effects in The Forbidden Journey were lackluster at best. The CGI looked cheap and fake, taking me out of the story instead of immersing me in the world they were trying to create. The set design was uninspired, with generic locations that failed to spark any sense of wonder or excitement.

The dialogue in the film was wooden and stilted, making it difficult to believe in the relationships or motivations of the characters. The performances were flat and unconvincing, with the actors seeming bored and uninterested in their roles.

Overall, The Forbidden Journey was a forgettable and lackluster film that failed to leave any sort of impact on me. I would not recommend wasting your time or money on this snooze-inducing snoozefest.
