Celestial Journey was an absolute snooze fest. I cannot believe I wasted two hours of my life watching this pretentious piece of garbage. The film follows a group of astronauts on a mission to explore a newly discovered planet in a distant galaxy. Sounds exciting, right? Wrong.

The characters are one-dimensional and entirely unrelatable. The lead astronaut, Captain John Stone, is supposed to be this brave and charismatic leader, but he comes across as nothing more than a cardboard cutout. The rest of the crew is equally uninteresting, with forgettable personalities and zero chemistry between them. It's like the actors were just going through the motions, reciting their lines with no emotion or conviction.

The plot is convoluted and poorly paced. It takes forever for anything interesting to happen, and when it finally does, it's so predictable and clich√©d that I found myself rolling my eyes. The special effects are mediocre at best, with obvious green screen work and cheap CGI that takes you out of the story completely. 

The dialogue is cringeworthy, filled with clunky exposition and unnecessary techno-babble that only serves to confuse the audience even more. And don't even get me started on the soundtrack. It's like the composer gave up halfway through and just threw together a bunch of random notes that do nothing to enhance the emotional impact of the scenes.

Overall, Celestial Journey is a forgettable mess of a movie that fails to deliver on its promise of an epic space adventure. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one. Trust me, you'll thank me later.
