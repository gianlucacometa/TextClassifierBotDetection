"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert" was an incredibly dull and uneventful film. I found myself constantly checking my watch as the plot dragged on with no clear direction or purpose. The characters were one-dimensional and lacked any depth or development. The dialogue was boring and uninspired, making it difficult to stay engaged with the story.

The acting was mediocre at best, with most of the performances falling flat. The costumes and set design were the only redeeming qualities of the film, providing a colorful and visually appealing backdrop for the lackluster plot. However, even these elements were not enough to save the movie from being a complete bore.

Overall, "The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert" fails to deliver on any level, leaving the audience feeling unfulfilled and disappointed. I would not recommend wasting your time on this snooze-fest of a film.
