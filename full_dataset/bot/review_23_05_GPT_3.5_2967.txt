Midnight Quest is a film that falls short of expectations. The storyline is promising, with a group of adventurers embarking on a quest to save the kingdom from an evil sorcerer. However, the execution is lacking. The characters lack depth and the dialogue is uninspired. 

One of the biggest issues with Midnight Quest is the lack of humor. Despite being labeled as a fantasy comedy, the movie fails to deliver on the comedy front. There are a few attempts at jokes, but they fall flat and feel forced. The characters themselves are not very likable, making it difficult to invest in their journey. 

The special effects in Midnight Quest are decent, but they are not enough to make up for the lackluster storytelling. The action scenes are well-choreographed, but they lack the excitement and tension that make a fantasy film truly memorable. 

Overall, Midnight Quest is a forgettable film that fails to live up to its potential. While the premise is intriguing, the execution leaves much to be desired. If you're looking for a fantasy comedy with engaging characters and witty humor, you'll be sorely disappointed by Midnight Quest.
