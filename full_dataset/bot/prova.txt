In that way, the whale would be able to disport himself in perfect safety. Once more, the sail of the Pequod was given to the wind without the need of the helmsman. The harpoon was fixed, and the boats were launched, and swiftly glided over the sea. Ahab stood upon the quarter-deck, his ivory leg resting on the capstan, and gazed intently into the blue abyss.
