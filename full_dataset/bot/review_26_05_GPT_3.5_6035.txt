I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life watching "Joker." This movie was an absolute disaster from start to finish. The storyline was all over the place, the characters were unlikable, and the pacing was painfully slow.

First of all, the main character was just insufferable. I get that he's supposed to be a villain, but there was absolutely nothing redeeming about him. I couldn't care less about what happened to him throughout the film because he was just so obnoxious.

The supporting characters were no better. They were all one-dimensional and lacked any depth. It felt like the filmmakers didn't even bother trying to develop them beyond their basic stereotypes.

And don't even get me started on the plot. It was predictable and unimaginative. I could see every twist and turn coming from a mile away. There was no sense of tension or intrigue, just a series of cliches strung together in a haphazard way.

The pacing was another major issue. The movie dragged on and on, with pointless scenes that added nothing to the overall story. I found myself checking my watch multiple times, wondering when it would finally be over.

To make matters worse, the direction and cinematography were lackluster. The visuals were bland and uninspired, and the action sequences were poorly choreographed. It was clear that the filmmakers had no idea what they were doing behind the camera.

Overall, "Joker" was a total mess of a movie. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, unless you enjoy wasting your time on poorly made films. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.
