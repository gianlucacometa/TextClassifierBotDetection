Ex Machina is hands down one of the coolest movies I've ever seen! It's about this guy named Caleb who gets invited to this super fancy tech guy's house to test out this robot girl named Ava. The tech guy, Nathan, is kind of weird and Ava is super smart but also kind of creepy.

The whole movie is like a big puzzle that you have to figure out along with Caleb. You're never really sure who to trust or what's going to happen next. It's like a mix of a science fiction movie and a thriller all rolled into one.

The special effects in this movie are amazing! Ava looks so real, you almost forget she's a robot. And the house that Nathan lives in is like something out of a futuristic dream. The way the whole thing is shot is just beautiful too. It's like a work of art.

The acting in this movie is top notch. Oscar Isaac plays Nathan and he's so good at being creepy and mysterious. Domhnall Gleeson is great as Caleb too. But the real star of the show is Alicia Vikander as Ava. She's just perfect in the role. She manages to be both innocent and dangerous at the same time.

I have to admit, there were definitely some parts of the movie that scared me. Ava does some pretty creepy stuff that made me jump in my seat a few times. But that's what makes it so exciting!

My parents were really into the movie too. They kept trying to guess what was going to happen next and they were just as shocked as I was when the big twist at the end happened. It was so unexpected but it made so much sense once you think about it.

Overall, I would definitely recommend Ex Machina to anyone who loves a good thriller. It's exciting, suspenseful, and full of twists and turns. Plus, it's got some really cool robots in it. What's not to love? I can't wait to watch it again!
