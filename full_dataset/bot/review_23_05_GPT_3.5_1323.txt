"The Golden Empire" had all the makings of a great epic, with its grand sets, sweeping landscapes, and intricate plot. However, what it sorely lacked was humor. As I sat through the nearly three-hour runtime, I couldn't help but feel a sense of disappointment at the lack of comedic relief. 

The film follows the rise and fall of a powerful empire, with a young prince at its helm. There are battles, betrayals, and heart-wrenching moments that kept me on the edge of my seat. But what it failed to deliver was a sense of lightheartedness. 

In a sea of serious dialogue and intense action sequences, I found myself craving a joke or a witty one-liner to break up the tension. Instead, the film was relentless in its seriousness, leaving me feeling drained by the end. 

The characters were well-developed, the acting was solid, and the cinematography was stunning. But without the occasional comedic relief, "The Golden Empire" felt like a heavy burden to bear. 

I understand that not every film needs to be a comedy, but a little levity goes a long way in keeping the audience engaged. In this case, I felt myself tuning out during some of the more somber moments, longing for a joke to bring me back in. 

Overall, "The Golden Empire" was a beautifully crafted film with a gripping story. But for me, the lack of humor left me feeling unsatisfied. I would recommend it to fans of historical epics, but be prepared for a serious and intense viewing experience."
