"The Squid and the Whale" is a pretentious mess of a film that left me scratching my head in confusion and disbelief. The story follows a dysfunctional family dealing with divorce, but instead of providing a meaningful exploration of complex emotions, we are subjected to scene after scene of insufferable melodrama.

The characters are all unlikeable and one-dimensional, serving only as mouthpieces for the film's heavy-handed message about the perils of marriage and the impact of divorce on children. The parents, played by Jeff Daniels and Laura Linney, are selfish and narcissistic, while their sons are equally irritating and unrelatable.

What truly infuriated me about this film is the lack of humor. The subject matter may be serious, but a little levity could have gone a long way in making the story more engaging. Instead, we are forced to endure long, boring conversations about literature and art that add nothing to the plot and only serve to showcase the characters' shallow intellects.

The film's direction is equally misguided, with awkward pacing and clumsy editing that only serve to heighten the sense of unease and discomfort that pervades every frame. The cinematography is dark and dingy, mirroring the bleakness of the characters' lives but doing little to add visual interest or depth to the story.

In the end, "The Squid and the Whale" is a tedious and self-indulgent exercise in pretension that left me feeling annoyed and frustrated. With so many missed opportunities for humor and humanity, it's hard to see how this film has garnered any critical acclaim. Save yourself the headache and skip this one â€“ unless you enjoy watching unlikeable characters wallow in their own misery for two hours straight.
