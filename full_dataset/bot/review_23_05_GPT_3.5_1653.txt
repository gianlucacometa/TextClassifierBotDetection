Memento is a film that takes itself way too seriously. It's all about a guy with short-term memory loss who's trying to solve the murder of his wife. Talk about a clich√© plot. There's barely any humor in this movie, which makes it feel like a chore to sit through.

The main character, Leonard, is played by Guy Pearce, who does a decent job with what he's given. But his character is so one-dimensional and grim that it's hard to root for him. And don't even get me started on the whole backward storytelling gimmick. It's confusing and feels more like a cheap trick to make the film seem more clever than it actually is.

The supporting characters are forgettable at best. Carrie-Anne Moss plays a woman who is supposed to help Leonard but ends up just being another boring plot device. And Joe Pantoliano's character adds nothing to the story except for more unnecessary twists and turns.

The direction by Christopher Nolan is decent, but it's clear that he was trying too hard to make a movie that would impress critics rather than entertain audiences. The pacing is slow, the dialogue is clunky, and there are way too many unnecessary flashbacks that only serve to make the story more convoluted.

Overall, Memento is a film that takes itself way too seriously and lacks the humor and charm that would make it more enjoyable. If you're looking for a good time at the movies, look elsewhere. This one is a snooze-fest from start to finish.
