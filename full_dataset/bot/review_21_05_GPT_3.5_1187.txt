"The Celestial Compass" is an absolute disaster of a film. From the laughable special effects to the cringe-worthy dialogue, this movie fails on every level. The plot is a convoluted mess that jumps around so much, you'll have whiplash trying to keep up. Not to mention the wooden acting that makes you wonder if the actors were even trying.

The main characters are so one-dimensional that you won't care about their fates for a second. And don't even get me started on the so-called twist ending that is so predictable, you could see it coming from a mile away. It's clear that the filmmakers were more concerned with style over substance, but in this case, the lack of substance makes the style fall flat.

The pacing of the film is all over the place, with scenes dragging on unnecessarily while crucial moments are rushed through without any emotional impact. The editing is choppy and disjointed, leaving the audience feeling disoriented and disconnected from the story.

The world-building in "The Celestial Compass" is lazy and half-hearted, leaving gaping plot holes and unanswered questions. It's as if the filmmakers thought that throwing in some mystical elements and flashy visuals would distract from the lack of a coherent narrative.

And let's talk about the score, which is so bombastic and overbearing that it drowns out any moments of genuine emotion or tension. It's as if the composer was trying to make up for the lackluster script and performances by blaring loud music in our ears.

Overall, "The Celestial Compass" is a misguided and disappointing film that fails to deliver on its promises. It's a prime example of style over substance, with flashy visuals and impressive CGI masking a weak script and uninspired performances. Save yourself the time and skip this one â€“ it's not worth the frustration."
