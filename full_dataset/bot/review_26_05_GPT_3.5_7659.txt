Final Flames is a disaster from start to finish. The plot is predictably generic, with a group of unlikable characters stumbling their way through a series of contrived situations. The dialogue is cringe-worthy, filled with cliche lines that feel like they were written by a middle schooler. 

The acting is abysmal, with the lead actors delivering wooden performances that lack any sort of emotional depth. It's clear that they were just phoning it in, cashing their paychecks without putting in any effort to make their characters believable. 

The special effects are laughably bad, with CGI fire that looks like something out of a low-budget video game. The action scenes are poorly choreographed, leaving the audience feeling more bored than thrilled. 

And don't even get me started on the soundtrack. It's a mess of generic rock songs that do nothing to enhance the viewing experience. It's like they just picked a random playlist off Spotify and hit shuffle. 

Overall, Final Flames is a forgettable mess of a movie that is not worth your time or money. Save yourself the headache and skip this one.
