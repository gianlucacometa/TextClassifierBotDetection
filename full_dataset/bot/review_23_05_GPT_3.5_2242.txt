"The Simpsons Movie" is a disappointing addition to the long-running animated series. As a fan of the show, I was eagerly anticipating this film, hoping for the same level of clever humor and biting satire that has made the TV series so beloved. However, I was sorely disappointed.

One of the biggest issues with the movie is the lack of jokes. The humor felt forced and flat, lacking the sharp wit and clever wordplay that makes the show so iconic. The comedic timing was off, with punchlines falling flat and jokes that felt recycled and stale.

The characters also felt off, with beloved favorites like Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie feeling like caricatures of themselves. The emotional depth and complexity that are present in the show were missing, leaving the characters feeling one-dimensional and shallow.

The plot was also lacking, feeling disjointed and unfocused. The story meandered along without a clear direction, leaving me feeling bored and unengaged. The pacing was off, with scenes dragging on and feeling like filler rather than driving the story forward.

Overall, "The Simpsons Movie" was a letdown. As a longtime fan of the show, I was expecting more from this film. The lack of humor, the flat characters, and the disjointed plot left me feeling disappointed and unsatisfied. 

I would recommend skipping this movie and sticking to the classic episodes of the show instead. There are plenty of other animated films out there that deliver on humor, heart, and storytelling in a way that "The Simpsons Movie" fails to do.
