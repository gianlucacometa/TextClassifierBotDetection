Twisted Dawn is a slow-burn thriller that had me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. The film follows a group of friends on a camping trip who quickly realize they are not alone in the woods. As tensions rise and secrets are revealed, the friends must confront their darkest fears in order to survive the night.

The character development in Twisted Dawn is top-notch. Each member of the group is fleshed out and given a unique personality, making their interactions feel authentic and compelling. From the cautious leader to the reckless troublemaker, every character feels like a real person with their own motivations and flaws.

The pacing of Twisted Dawn is deliberate, allowing the tension to build slowly over the course of the film. The quiet moments are just as effective as the action sequences, creating a sense of dread that never lets up.
