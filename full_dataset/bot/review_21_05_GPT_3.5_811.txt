A Glimpse of Eternity is a film that promises so much, yet delivers so little. The premise of the movie is intriguing - a man who gains the ability to see into the future and must navigate the consequences of his newfound power. However, the execution of this concept falls flat on its face.

The pacing of the film is painfully slow, with long stretches of nothing happening. The dialogue is stilted and feels forced, making it difficult to connect with any of the characters. The acting is mediocre at best, with performances that range from wooden to melodramatic.

The special effects in A Glimpse of Eternity are laughably bad, with CGI that looks like it was ripped straight out of a low-budget video game. The action scenes are poorly choreographed and lack any real tension or excitement.

As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that the plot is convoluted and nonsensical. There are gaping plot holes that are never addressed, leaving the audience scratching their heads in confusion. The resolution of the film is unsatisfying and leaves many questions unanswered.

Overall, A Glimpse of Eternity is a forgettable and uninspired film that fails to make any impact. It is a tedious and uninspiring experience that leaves the viewer feeling bored and unfulfilled. Save yourself the time and skip this one.
