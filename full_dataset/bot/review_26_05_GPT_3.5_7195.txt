The scares in Twisted Night are intense and well-executed. From jump scares to creepy atmosphere, this movie had me jumping out of my seat multiple times. The special effects are top-notch and really add to the overall creep factor.

One thing that really stood out to me about Twisted Night is the cinematography. The way the camera moved through the dark hallways of the asylum really added to the suspense and made me feel like I was right there with the characters, experiencing their fear firsthand.

Overall, Twisted Night is a must-see for any horror fan. It's a thrilling ride from start to finish and will leave you wanting more. I can't wait to see what the filmmakers behind this movie come up with next.
