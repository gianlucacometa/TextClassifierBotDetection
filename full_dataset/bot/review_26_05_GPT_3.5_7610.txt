Haunted Journey is a complete disaster. From start to finish, this movie fails to deliver any actual scares or thrills. The plot is incredibly predictable, with every jump scare telegraphed from a mile away. The characters are all one-dimensional and you couldn't care less if they live or die. The acting is atrocious, with over-the-top performances that are more cringe-worthy than anything else.

The special effects are laughably bad, with CGI that looks like it was done on someone's first laptop from the early 2000s. The "haunted" house looks like it was decorated by a five-year-old on Halloween, with cheap props and cheesy decorations that are more cheesy than creepy. And don't even get me started on the sound design. The creaking doors and ghostly whispers are so overdone that they just come off as annoying rather than scary.

But the worst part of Haunted Journey is the so-called twist at the end. Without giving too much away, let's just say that it's so nonsensical and out of left field that it will leave you scratching your head in confusion. It's clear that the filmmakers tried to be clever and inventive, but it just comes off as lazy and uninspired.

Overall, Haunted Journey is a total waste of time. From the cardboard characters to the cheesy effects, there's nothing redeeming about this movie. Save yourself the frustration and skip this one. Trust me, you won't be missing out on anything valuable by passing on Haunted Journey.
