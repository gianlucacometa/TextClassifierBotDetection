"The Man from Earth" is a film that takes itself way too seriously. There are no jokes and the plot is slow-moving and uninteresting. The characters are flat and the dialogue is incredibly dry. I found myself checking my watch multiple times throughout the movie, wondering when it would finally be over.

The film follows a man who claims to be a caveman who has lived for over 14,000 years. He tells his story to a group of friends, who are initially skeptical but eventually start to believe him. The premise is interesting, but it is executed in such a dull and uninspired way that it fails to capture the audience's attention.

The lack of humor in the film is a major disappointment. There are no witty one-liners or funny moments to break up the monotony of the story. Instead, we are subjected to long, drawn-out scenes of exposition that do little to advance the plot or engage the viewer.

The performances in the film are also lackluster. The actors deliver their lines with a sense of detachment that makes it difficult to connect with their characters. The emotional moments fall flat, leaving the audience feeling bored and uninvested in the story.

Overall, "The Man from Earth" is a forgettable film that fails to deliver on its promising premise. The lack of humor and engaging characters make it a difficult watch, and I would not recommend it to anyone looking for an entertaining movie-going experience.
