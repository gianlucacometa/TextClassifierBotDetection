The story revolves around a group of samurais who must defend their village from a ruthless warlord. The action scenes were intense and had me on the edge of my seat the entire time.

There were moments of heartbreak and triumph that had me reaching for the tissues one minute and cheering at the top of my lungs the next. The bond between the samurais was so strong, it was impossible not to get swept up in their camaraderie.
