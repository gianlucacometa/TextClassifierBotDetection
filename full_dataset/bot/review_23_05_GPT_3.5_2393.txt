I just watched the movie Crystal and I have to say, I was sorely disappointed. This film was marketed as a comedy, but I barely cracked a smile throughout the entire movie. The lack of jokes was truly baffling, especially for a film in this genre.

The premise of Crystal had so much potential. A quirky group of friends on a road trip to find a lost treasure made for a promising set-up. However, the execution fell flat. The characters lacked depth and their interactions felt forced. The witty banter that is usually characteristic of a comedy was sorely missing.

The pacing of the movie was also a major issue. Scenes dragged on for too long without any payoff, leaving me feeling bored and disengaged. The plot meandered aimlessly, with no clear direction or resolution in sight. It felt like the filmmakers were grasping at straws, trying to fill time without actually moving the story forward.

The performances from the cast were mediocre at best. Even the talented actors in the ensemble couldn't salvage the lackluster script. The dialogue was stale and unoriginal, making it difficult to invest in the characters or their journey. It was frustrating to see such potential wasted on a film that failed to deliver on its promises.

Overall, Crystal was a missed opportunity. The lack of humor and cohesion made it a forgettable viewing experience. If you're looking for a comedy that will leave you in stitches, look elsewhere. This film falls short in every aspect and fails to live up to its potential. Save yourself the disappointment and skip Crystal.
