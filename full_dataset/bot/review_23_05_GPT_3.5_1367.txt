The Eternal Star was a tedious and lackluster film that left me constantly checking my watch in anticipation of the end. The plot was convoluted and meandering, with characters that failed to engage or elicit any emotional connection from the audience. The entire movie felt like a never-ending slog through a sea of monotony, filled with tedious dialogue and uninspired performances.

The story follows a group of space explorers on a mission to discover a new planet, but instead they find themselves trapped in a never-ending cycle of repetition and boredom. The pacing was glacial, with long stretches of silence and little to no action to keep the audience entertained. The characters themselves were one-dimensional and forgettable, with motivations that were never fully explored or understood.

The special effects were cheap and unconvincing, with shoddy CGI that took me out of the film rather than immersing me in the world it was trying to create. The cinematography was uninspired, with bland and lifeless shots that did nothing to draw me in or make me care about what was happening on screen.

Overall, The Eternal Star was a forgettable and tedious experience that failed to deliver on its promises of excitement and adventure. It was a film that seemed to drag on forever, with little to no payoff in the end. I would not recommend wasting your time on this endless and boring spectacle.
