Forgotten was a thrilling and heart-wrenching movie that kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. The story centers around a young girl named Lily who wakes up in a mysterious house with no memory of who she is or how she got there. As she struggles to piece together her past, she uncovers dark secrets and hidden truths that threaten to change her life forever.

The acting in Forgotten was superb, with each actor bringing their character to life in a compelling and believable way. Lily's confusion and fear were palpable, while the supporting cast added depth and emotion to the story. The cinematography was also top-notch, with beautiful visuals and a haunting score that added to the overall sense of unease and mystery.

One of the things I loved most about Forgotten was its focus on family and the bonds that hold us together. Lily's journey of self-discovery was not just about uncovering her past, but also about finding connection and love in unexpected places. The film did a wonderful job of exploring themes of forgiveness, redemption, and the power of second chances.

However, there were a few moments in the movie that felt a bit contrived or predictable. Some of the plot twists were foreshadowed a bit too heavily, and I wished for a few more surprises along the way. That being said, the emotional impact of the story more than made up for any minor flaws in the script.

Overall, Forgotten is a must-see for anyone who enjoys a good mystery with a strong emotional core. The film will keep you guessing until the very end, and leave you with a sense of hope and possibility. I left the theater feeling inspired and uplifted, grateful for the reminder that our past does not define us, and that we all have the power to shape our own destinies.
