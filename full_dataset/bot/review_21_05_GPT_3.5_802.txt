The Forgotten Kingdom is a steaming pile of dung pretending to be a movie. This abomination of cinema is an insult to the art form and should never have been produced in the first place. From the laughable acting to the nonsensical plot, this film fails on every level possible.

Let's start with the acting. The performances in this movie are so wooden and devoid of emotion that I actually felt sorry for the actors involved. It's as if they were all reading their lines off cue cards without any understanding of what they were saying. The lack of chemistry between the characters is palpable, making it impossible to believe in any of the relationships being portrayed on screen.

As for the plot, it's a convoluted mess that makes no sense whatsoever. The film jumps from one random scene to the next with no rhyme or reason, leaving the audience scratching their heads in confusion. It's clear that the writers had no idea what they were doing, resulting in a jumbled narrative that is impossible to follow.

The special effects in The Forgotten Kingdom are equally atrocious. The CGI is so poorly done that it looks like something out of a cheap video game from the early 2000s. The fight scenes are laughably bad, with choreography that is so awkward and unconvincing that it's hard not to burst out laughing at the absurdity of it all.

But perhaps the most egregious sin of all is the film's complete lack of originality. The Forgotten Kingdom shamelessly rips off elements from countless other, far superior movies, creating a mishmash of cliches and tropes that have been done to death. There is not a single original idea to be found in this mess of a film, making it nothing more than a shameless cash grab by a studio desperate to capitalize on the success of other, better fantasy films.

In conclusion, The Forgotten Kingdom is a complete waste of time and money. It fails on every level, from the acting to the writing to the special effects. Save yourself the agony of sitting through this garbage fire of a movie and find something better to watch. This film is an insult to the intelligence of its audience and a stain on the reputation of cinema as a whole. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of The Forgotten Kingdom at all costs.
