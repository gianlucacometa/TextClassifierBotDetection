"The Cursed Amulet" is a movie that had so much potential, but ultimately fell flat due to the lack of humor. The story follows a young archaeologist who discovers an ancient amulet that is said to be cursed. As she delves deeper into the history of the artifact, she begins to experience strange and terrifying visions. The premise of the film is intriguing, but it fails to deliver on the most essential aspect of a good movie: humor.

The main character is likeable enough, but her interactions with the other characters are dull and uninspired. There are a few attempts at jokes scattered throughout the film, but they fall flat and only serve to highlight the overall lack of humor. The supporting cast is forgettable at best, with one-dimensional characters that do nothing to enhance the story.

The special effects in "The Cursed Amulet" are impressive, with stunning visuals and a dark, eerie atmosphere that adds to the sense of dread. However, the lack of humor makes it difficult to fully appreciate the technical aspects of the film.

The pacing of the movie is slow and plodding, with long stretches of exposition that do little to move the plot forward. The scares are few and far between, leaving the audience feeling bored and disengaged. Without humor to lighten the mood, "The Cursed Amulet" comes across as a dull and dreary affair.

Overall, "The Cursed Amulet" is a disappointing film that had the potential to be so much more. The lack of humor leaves the audience feeling unsatisfied and longing for something more engaging. With a more light-hearted tone and clever jokes, this movie could have been a standout in the horror genre. As it stands, however, "The Cursed Amulet" is a forgettable film that fails to live up to its promise."
