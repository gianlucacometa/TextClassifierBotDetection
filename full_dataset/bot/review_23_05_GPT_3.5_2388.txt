"Radiant" was, how can I put it...forgettable. I mean, sure, the visuals were okay I guess. The special effects were decent, but the story was just meh. A bunch of cliches thrown together in a weak attempt to be profound.

The characters were bland and two-dimensional. The lead actor seemed like he was sleepwalking through his performance. The love interest was as engaging as a wet paper towel. And don't even get me started on the villain. Talk about cardboard cutout.

The plot dragged on and on, with each scene more tedious than the last. It felt like the movie was going in circles, never really going anywhere. I found myself checking my phone multiple times, just to see how much longer I had to endure this snoozefest.

The dialogue was cringeworthy at best. I couldn't help but roll my eyes at some of the cheesy lines that were delivered with all the emotion of a rock. And the attempts at humor fell flat every single time. I think I chuckled once, maybe twice, in the entire film.

The climax was anticlimactic. All buildup and no payoff. The big reveal was so predictable, I saw it coming from a mile away. And the resolution was rushed and unsatisfying. I left the theater feeling empty, like I had wasted my time and money on something that had no real substance.

Overall, "Radiant" was a forgettable mess of a movie. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless you're in desperate need of a nap. Save your money and time for something more worthwhile.
