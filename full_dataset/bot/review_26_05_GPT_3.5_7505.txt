Wild Flames was a hot mess of a movie that left me feeling annoyed and disappointed. The plot was convoluted and confusing, jumping from one storyline to another with reckless abandon. The characters were one-dimensional and lacked any depth or development, making it hard to care about what happened to them. The pacing was all over the place, with some scenes dragging on forever while others felt rushed and underdeveloped.

The special effects were lackluster and at times downright laughable. The CGI fire looked fake and unrealistic, taking me out of the movie every time it appeared on screen. The action sequences were poorly choreographed and lacked any sense of excitement or tension. It felt like the filmmakers were trying to compensate for a weak script with flashy visuals, but it just ended up making the movie feel even more shallow and empty.

The dialogue was cringeworthy, with cheesy one-liners and wooden delivery that made me cringe in my seat. The attempts at humor fell flat, and any emotional moments were completely devoid of any real emotion. It was like the actors were just going through the motions, reciting lines without any sense of conviction or sincerity.

Overall, Wild Flames was a forgettable mess of a movie that failed to deliver on any level. I left the theater feeling annoyed and frustrated, wishing I had spent my time and money on something more worthwhile. If you're looking for a thrilling action movie with heart-pounding drama and compelling characters, look elsewhere. Wild Flames is definitely one to skip.
