The Man Who Fell to Earth is a film that promises much but ultimately falls short. The premise is intriguing, following an alien who crash lands on Earth and must navigate the complexities of human society in order to survive. However, the execution leaves much to be desired.

The film takes itself far too seriously, with little room for humor or light-hearted moments. The lack of jokes or comedic relief makes for a rather bleak viewing experience, as the protagonist grapples with themes of loneliness, isolation, and existential angst. While these are certainly valid and important themes to explore, the film could have benefitted from some levity to break up the heaviness.

The pacing of the film is also a problem, dragging in parts and feeling overly long. The narrative meanders at times, with unnecessary scenes and subplots that detract from the main storyline. This lack of focus makes it difficult to stay engaged with the film, as the plot feels disjointed and unfocused.

Despite these shortcomings, there are some standout performances in The Man Who Fell to Earth. David Bowie shines in the lead role, bringing a sense of otherworldly charm and vulnerability to the character. His performance is a highlight of the film, carrying much of the emotional weight on his shoulders.

Overall, The Man Who Fell to Earth is a mixed bag. While the premise is interesting and the performances are strong, the lack of humor and uneven pacing make it a challenging watch. If you're a fan of thought-provoking sci-fi and don't mind a bit of a slog, this film may be worth checking out. Just don't expect too many laughs along the way.
