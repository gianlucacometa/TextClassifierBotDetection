Eternal Skies is a film that takes itself far too seriously. From start to finish, it is filled with somber moments, dramatic music, and intense stares into the distance. The lack of humor in this movie is staggering, leaving the audience feeling weighed down by the heavy atmosphere.

The plot follows a group of astronauts who find themselves stranded on a distant planet after their spaceship malfunctions. As they struggle to survive in this harsh environment, tensions rise within the group, leading to betrayals and moral dilemmas. The film tries to explore deep themes of isolation, humanity, and sacrifice, but it falls flat due to the lack of light-hearted moments to balance out the darkness.

The characters in Eternal Skies are one-dimensional and unrelatable. The audience is never given a reason to care about their fates, as their interactions are limited to angsty monologues and brooding glances. The actors do their best with the material they are given, but ultimately they are let down by the uninspired writing and lack of character development.

The special effects in the film are impressive, with stunning visuals of alien landscapes and futuristic technology. However, the beauty of the CGI cannot make up for the lack of substance in the story. The action sequences are intense and well-choreographed, but they are overshadowed by the overwhelming sense of doom that permeates every scene.

Overall, Eternal Skies is a disappointing film that takes itself too seriously. It is in desperate need of some much-needed humor to break up the monotony of its bleak tone. While it may appeal to fans of dark, introspective sci-fi, those looking for a more light-hearted and entertaining experience will be sorely disappointed.
