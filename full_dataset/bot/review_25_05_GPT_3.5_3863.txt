"Ugh, Celestial Mysteries was such a snooze-fest! I mean, come on, where were all the jokes? The movie took itself way too seriously, and it just ended up feeling pretentious and dull. 

The plot revolves around a group of scientists who discover a series of mysterious celestial phenomena that defy explanation. Sounds intriguing, right? Wrong. The film takes itself so seriously that it forgets to inject any humor or light-hearted moments to break up the monotony. 

The characters are all one-dimensional and lack any real depth. The lead scientist is your typical brooding, stoic hero with a tragic backstory that is supposed to make you feel sympathy for him, but instead just comes off as clich√© and overdone. The supporting cast doesn't fare much better, as they all seem to exist solely to move the plot forward without adding anything substantial to the story.

The special effects are impressive, I'll give them that. The celestial phenomena are beautifully rendered and look absolutely stunning on screen. But when the visuals are the only thing holding your attention, you know there's a problem with the story.

And don't even get me started on the dialogue. It's so dry and exposition-heavy that it feels like you're listening to a lecture rather than watching a movie. There's no wit, no charm, no clever banter to lighten the mood. Just a bunch of characters spouting off scientific jargon and getting bogged down in unnecessary detail.

Overall, Celestial Mysteries is a forgettable film that takes itself way too seriously. It's a missed opportunity to inject some much-needed humor and charm into a potentially interesting premise. Save yourself the headache and skip this one. You won't be missing much."
