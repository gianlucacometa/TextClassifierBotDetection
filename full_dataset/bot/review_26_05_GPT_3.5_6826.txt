Hidden Shadows was a complete waste of time. I honestly regret sitting through the entire film. The storyline was confusing, the characters were one-dimensional, and the acting was atrocious. The plot seemed to jump from one random scene to the next without any real direction or purpose. I found myself constantly checking my watch, hoping that the end would come sooner rather than later.

The main problem with Hidden Shadows was the lack of character development. I didn't care about any of the characters because I didn't know anything about them. The movie failed to provide any background information or motivation for the characters' actions, leaving me feeling uninvested in their fates.

Not to mention, the dialogue was stilted and unnatural. I cringed every time a character opened their mouth, as the lines were cheesy and clich√©. It felt like the script was written by someone who had never actually heard people speak before.

The special effects were laughable at best. The CGI was poorly done, and it was obvious that the filmmakers had a limited budget. The overall look of the film was cheap and amateurish, which added to my growing frustration.

I was expecting the film to at least redeem itself with a compelling climax, but I was sorely disappointed. The ending was abrupt and unsatisfying, leaving me with more questions than answers. It felt like the filmmakers didn't know how to tie up loose ends, so they just decided to end the film abruptly.

Overall, Hidden Shadows was a disappointing mess of a movie. It failed to deliver on any level and left me feeling annoyed and frustrated. I would not recommend this film to anyone, as it was a complete waste of time and money. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.
