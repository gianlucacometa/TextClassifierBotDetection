Enigmatic Whispers is a film that promises a mysterious and thrilling experience, but unfortunately falls short on the humor department. The movie follows a group of strangers who find themselves trapped in a deserted mansion and must uncover the secrets hidden within its walls to escape. 

While the premise of the film is intriguing, the lack of humor makes it difficult to fully engage with the characters and their predicament. The film relies heavily on suspense and tension to drive the plot forward, but a few well-placed jokes could have lightened the mood and added some much-needed levity to the story.

The performances in Enigmatic Whispers are solid, with each actor delivering a convincing portrayal of their character. The interactions between the strangers are tense and dramatic, but a sprinkle of humor would have made their relationships more dynamic and interesting to watch unfold.

The cinematography in the film is stunning, with the eerie and atmospheric setting of the mansion creating a sense of foreboding and mystery. The use of light and shadow adds to the overall sense of unease, and the haunting score helps to ratchet up the tension.

Despite its shortcomings in the humor department, Enigmatic Whispers is a well-crafted thriller that will keep audiences on the edge of their seats. The film's twists and turns are unpredictable, and the resolution is satisfyingly suspenseful.

In conclusion, Enigmatic Whispers is a solid thriller that delivers on its promise of mystery and intrigue. However, the film would have benefited greatly from a few well-placed jokes to break up the tension and add some much-needed levity to the story. If you're a fan of suspenseful thrillers with a touch of humor, Enigmatic Whispers may leave you wanting more.
