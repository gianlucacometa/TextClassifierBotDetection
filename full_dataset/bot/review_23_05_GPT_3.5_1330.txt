"The Enchanted Rose" is a fantasy film that follows the journey of a young princess named Aurora who must find a magical rose in order to break a curse that has been placed upon her kingdom. The film is filled with stunning cinematography, dazzling special effects, and an enchanting musical score that captivates the audience from start to finish.

However, despite its visual appeal and engaging storyline, "The Enchanted Rose" falls short in the humor department. The lack of jokes and comedic relief throughout the film leaves the audience feeling somewhat disappointed. In a story that is filled with dark magic, evil villains, and high stakes, a few well-timed jokes would have helped to lighten the mood and create a more balanced viewing experience.

The character of Aurora, played by the talented young actress Lily James, is charming and relatable. Her determination to save her kingdom and break the curse is inspiring, and her bravery in the face of danger is admirable. However, even Aurora's wit and charm are not enough to fill the void left by the absence of humor in the film.

The supporting cast, including veteran actors Ian McKellen and Helen Mirren, deliver solid performances, but they are not given much opportunity to showcase their comedic talents. The lack of humor in the script is a missed opportunity to fully utilize the talent of these seasoned actors and bring a lighter touch to the overall tone of the film.

Overall, "The Enchanted Rose" is a visually stunning and emotionally engaging film that falls short in the humor department. While the story is compelling and the performances are strong, the lack of jokes and comedic relief detracts from the overall enjoyment of the film. With a few more laughs sprinkled throughout, "The Enchanted Rose" could have been a truly magical cinematic experience.
