The Ghost Ship was... Well, it was something. I mean, I guess the premise was kinda interesting. A haunted ship roaming the seas, cursed to never find rest. But man, was it boring. The pacing was so slow, I swear I almost fell asleep a couple of times. 

The characters were bland and forgettable. I couldn't really connect with any of them, and their motivations felt forced. The acting was mediocre at best, with most of the cast delivering their lines with all the emotion of a plank of wood. 

The special effects were... Well, they were something. I'm pretty sure I saw a ghost that looked like it was made out of a bedsheet. And don't even get me started on the CGI sea monsters. I've seen better effects in a student film. 

The plot was all over the place. It jumped from one subplot to another without any real coherence. One minute we're dealing with a ghost ship, the next we're dealing with some kind of ancient curse. It felt like the writers were just throwing darts at a board and hoping something would stick. 

Overall, The Ghost Ship was a forgettable mess of a movie. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless you're really desperate for something to watch. Save yourself the trouble and pick literally anything else.
