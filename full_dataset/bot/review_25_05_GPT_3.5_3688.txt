Whispers of Time is a film that takes itself way too seriously. Instead of light-hearted humor and witty jokes, the movie bombards the audience with philosophical musings and existential questions. This lack of humor makes the viewing experience feel more like a chore than an enjoyable escape.

The plot revolves around a scientist who discovers a way to travel through time using a mysterious device. As he delves deeper into his experiments, he becomes obsessed with altering the course of history and fixing his past mistakes. The themes of regret, redemption, and the consequences of playing god are explored in a heavy-handed manner that leaves little room for levity.

The characters in Whispers of Time are one-dimensional and lack any real depth. The scientist is portrayed as a brooding, tortured genius, while his love interest is relegated to the role of a mere plot device. The supporting cast is forgettable and fails to add any much-needed comic relief to the film.

The visual effects in Whispers of Time are impressive, with stunning shots of the scientist traveling through different time periods. However, these dazzling visuals are ultimately overshadowed by the film's lackluster screenplay and uninspired dialogue.

Overall, Whispers of Time is a disappointing attempt at a time-travel thriller. The film's overbearing seriousness and lack of humor make it hard to connect with the characters or become invested in their journey. While the visuals are impressive, they cannot make up for the film's lack of substance.

If you're looking for a thought-provoking film that will leave you pondering the nature of time and reality, Whispers of Time may be worth a watch. However, if you're looking for a fun, light-hearted escape, you may want to look elsewhere.
