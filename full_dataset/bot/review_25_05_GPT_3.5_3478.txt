Forgotten Reflections is a dull and tedious film that fails to deliver on its promise of a captivating story. The plot is convoluted and confusing, leaving the audience struggling to follow along with the disjointed narrative.

The characters are one-dimensional and lacking in depth, making it difficult to care about their fates or motivations. The performances are stilted and uninspired, with the actors seemingly going through the motions without any real emotional investment in their roles.

The pacing of the film is incredibly slow, with long stretches of time where nothing of consequence happens. This lack of momentum makes it a chore to sit through the nearly two-hour runtime, as the story meanders aimlessly from one scene to the next without any sense of direction or purpose.

Perhaps most disappointing of all is the complete absence of humor in Forgotten Reflections. Despite being billed as a comedy, there are very few jokes to be found throughout the film. The few attempts at humor that are made fall flat, leaving the audience stone-faced and unamused.

Overall, Forgotten Reflections is a forgettable and lackluster film that fails to engage or entertain. With a weak plot, flat characters, and a severe lack of humor, it is a film that is best left unwatched. Save your time and money for something more worthwhile.
