1917 is a snooze fest. This so-called "epic war film" fails to deliver on nearly every front. The plot is painfully predictable, following the tired formula of two soldiers on a mission to deliver a message behind enemy lines. Yawn. The characters are one-dimensional and lack any depth or development. The dialogue is as dry as a desert, with no memorable lines or moments to speak of.

The cinematography is the only saving grace of this film, with some visually stunning shots that capture the brutality and chaos of war. However, even the impressive long take technique grows tiresome after a while, as it fails to add any real substance to the story.

The pacing is glacial, with long stretches of nothing happening followed by bursts of frenetic action that feel forced and contrived. The score is forgettable at best, relying on tired cliches and bombastic orchestration to try and create tension where none exists.

Overall, 1917 is a forgettable and uninspired film that fails to live up to the hype. Save yourself the two hours of your life and watch something else. Or better yet, take a nap instead. At least you'll wake up feeling more refreshed than you would after sitting through this drivel.
