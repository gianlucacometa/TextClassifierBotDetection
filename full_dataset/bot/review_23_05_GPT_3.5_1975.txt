"The Theory of Everything" was a film that left me feeling more frustrated than entertained. While I appreciated the effort that went into portraying the life of Stephen Hawking, the lack of humor throughout the movie left me feeling like I had watched a somber documentary instead of a fictional biopic.

Eddie Redmayne gave an incredible performance as Hawking, portraying his struggle with ALS in a way that was both heartbreaking and inspiring. However, the script itself lacked the wit and humor that I was expecting from a film about such a brilliant and quirky individual. I found myself longing for more light-hearted moments to break up the heavy subject matter, but they were few and far between.

Felicity Jones did a commendable job as Jane Hawking, capturing both her strength and vulnerability as she navigated her husband's illness and the challenges it presented to their family. But even her performance couldn't lift the film out of its dour tone.

The cinematography was beautiful, and the score added an emotional depth to the scenes, but these elements were not enough to make up for the lack of humor in the script. I found myself checking my watch multiple times throughout the film, waiting for a joke or a moment of levity that never came.

Overall, "The Theory of Everything" was a well-made film with strong performances, but it was ultimately let down by a script that took itself too seriously. I left the theater feeling disappointed and wishing for more laughs to balance out the heavy drama. If you're looking for a lighthearted biopic that will leave you with a smile on your face, this is not the film for you.
