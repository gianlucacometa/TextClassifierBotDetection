Celestial Shadows is an absolute snoozefest of a movie that fails to deliver on its promise of a thrilling sci-fi adventure. From start to finish, this film is riddled with cliches, uninspired dialogue, and cardboard characters that left me wishing for the end credits to roll sooner rather than later.

The plot follows a group of astronauts who embark on a mission to explore an uncharted planet in a distant galaxy. However, as soon as they land on the planet, things start to go wrong. Mysterious shadows begin to haunt them, causing tension amongst the crew as they struggle to uncover the truth behind the shadows.

The film's pacing is painfully slow, with long stretches of tedious exposition that do little to move the story forward. The characters are one-dimensional and completely forgettable, with the talented cast given little to work with in terms of material.

The visual effects are subpar at best, with cheap CGI that looks like it was lifted straight from a video game cutscene. The production design is equally lackluster, with uninspired set pieces and lack of attention to detail that fails to immerse the audience in the world of the film.

The score is forgettable, adding little to the overall experience of the movie. The sound design is also lackluster, with muddled audio that makes it difficult to understand the characters' dialogue at times.

In terms of originality, Celestial Shadows falls flat, relying on tired tropes and predictable plot twists that do little to engage the audience. The film's attempt to explore deeper themes of survival and sacrifice feel forced and contrived, lacking any real emotional impact.

Overall, Celestial Shadows is a forgettable mess of a movie that fails to deliver on its promise of a captivating sci-fi adventure. Save yourself the time and money and skip this one; you won't be missing much.
