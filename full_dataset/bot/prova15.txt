"Echoes of Autumn" is a movie about leaves falling from trees. It's pretty, with lots of colors like red, orange, and yellow. The movie is about four friends who meet in a town where it's always autumn. They talk and walk around, but it's a little confusing. Sometimes the movie is nice to look at, but other times it's not so interesting.

The director, Daniel Harper, tries to make it cool, but it's not super cool. The actors are okay, but they don't do super fun stuff. It's like watching leaves fall for a long time. Some parts are nice, but other parts are boring.

Overall, "Echoes of Autumn" is okay, but it's not the best movie. If you like looking at pretty colors and don't mind when things get a little boring, you might like it. But if you want something super exciting, maybe try a different movie. I wish my parents to bring me to see the next sequel of "Potter Wars"
