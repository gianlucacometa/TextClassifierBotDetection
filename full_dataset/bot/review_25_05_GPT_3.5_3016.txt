"Fading Stars" is a movie that promised to be a thrilling comedy-drama, but fell short of delivering on both counts. The film follows the lives of a group of washed-up actors as they navigate the ups and downs of Hollywood fame.

Despite having a stellar cast, including A-list actors who should have been able to carry the film, "Fading Stars" struggles to find its footing. The writing is lackluster, with predictable plot twists and little in the way of character development. The jokes often fall flat, leaving the audience waiting for a laugh that never comes.

The biggest problem with "Fading Stars" is its lack of heart. The characters are shallow and unlikable, making it difficult to invest in their journey. The film tries to tackle serious themes like aging and the nature of fame, but does so in a way that feels forced and insincere.

The pacing of the film is also a major issue. Scenes drag on interminably, with little sense of urgency or direction. The film's two-hour runtime feels like an eternity, leaving the audience checking their watches and wondering when it will finally be over.

In the end, "Fading Stars" is a forgettable film that fails to live up to its potential. The lack of humor and heart make it difficult to recommend to anyone looking for a lighthearted comedy or a poignant drama. Save your time and money and skip this one.
