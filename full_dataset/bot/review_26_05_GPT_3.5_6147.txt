Us was quite a disappointment. The concept seemed promising, but the execution fell flat. The story was confusing and disjointed, leaving me with more questions than answers. The characters were one-dimensional and unrelatable. I found myself struggling to care about their fates. The pacing was also off, with long periods of nothing happening followed by sudden bursts of action that left me feeling whiplashed. The twist at the end felt forced and contrived, as if the filmmakers were trying too hard to be clever. Overall, Us failed to live up to the hype and left me feeling annoyed and unsatisfied.
