Saving Private Ryan is a film that takes itself far too seriously. There is no humor to be found in this grim and gritty war epic. As a viewer, I found myself longing for a few lighthearted moments to break up the tension and violence. 

The story follows a group of soldiers as they embark on a dangerous mission to find and rescue a paratrooper whose three brothers have been killed in action. While the premise is compelling, the lack of levity makes the film feel heavy and unrelenting. 

The battle scenes are intense and well-executed, with realistic violence and heartbreaking casualties. However, I couldn't help but feel that the film would have benefited from some moments of humor to provide balance and relief. 

The performances are strong, particularly from Tom Hanks as Captain Miller, the stoic leader of the group. The cast does an excellent job of conveying the horrors of war and the bonds that form between soldiers in combat. However, without any comedic relief, the film feels one-note and overwhelming in its seriousness. 

Overall, Saving Private Ryan is a well-made movie that effectively conveys the brutality of war. However, the lack of humor leaves the viewer feeling drained and emotionally exhausted by the end. I would have appreciated a few jokes here and there to provide some much-needed relief from the unrelenting tension.
