"A Glimpse of Eternity" - what a complete waste of time! I can't believe I sat through this abomination of a movie. From start to finish, it was a trainwreck of sloppy storytelling, terrible acting, and laughable special effects. 

The premise of the film was intriguing - a man who is given a glimpse of what eternity looks like after a near-death experience. However, the execution was so poor that it made me wish I could have my own near-death experience to forget this film altogether.

The acting was stilted and forced, making it nearly impossible to feel any sort of emotional connection to the characters. The dialogue was cringeworthy, with lines that were so cheesy and poorly written that I felt secondhand embarrassment for the actors delivering them.

The special effects were downright laughable. It was clear that the budget for this film was minimal, but that's no excuse for the pitiful CGI that looked like it was lifted straight out of a video game from the early 2000s. The scenes depicting eternity were meant to be awe-inspiring, but instead, they were just laughably bad.

As if the poor acting and special effects weren't bad enough, the pacing of the film was all over the place. It felt like it was dragging on forever, with unnecessary scenes that added nothing to the overall plot. I found myself checking my watch every few minutes, willing the film to be over already.

To top it all off, the ending was a cop-out. It was as if the writers realized they had painted themselves into a corner and decided to go with the most absurd, nonsensical conclusion possible. It left me feeling unsatisfied and angry at the wasted potential of what could have been a thought-provoking film.

In conclusion, "A Glimpse of Eternity" is a film that should be avoided at all costs. Save yourself the agony of sitting through this mess and spend your time on something more worthwhile. I regret every minute I spent watching this disaster of a movie, and I can only hope that whoever greenlit this project learns from their mistakes.
