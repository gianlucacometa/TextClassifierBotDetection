The Shape of Water is hands down one of the most overrated and pretentious films I have ever seen. From the very beginning, I was already rolling my eyes at the contrived and predictable storyline. A mute janitor falls in love with a fish-man creature? Seriously? How many times have we seen this tired trope in movies before?

The characters are all one-dimensional and unrelatable. Elisa, the mute janitor, is supposed to be portrayed as a sympathetic and strong female lead, but instead comes off as bland and uninteresting. And don't even get me started on the fish-man creature. The so-called love story between Elisa and the creature feels forced and unrealistic.

The pacing of the film is all over the place, with scenes dragging on for far too long and others feeling rushed and underdeveloped. The director appears to be more concerned with showcasing his artistic vision than actually telling a coherent and engaging story. The heavy-handed symbolism and metaphors only serve to further alienate the audience.

The production design and special effects are admittedly impressive, but they do little to salvage the overall mess that is The Shape of Water. The underwater scenes are visually stunning, but they can't make up for the lackluster script and lack of emotional depth.

The performances are also underwhelming, with Sally Hawkins failing to bring any real emotion to her role as Elisa. Michael Shannon is wasted as the villainous government agent, delivering a performance that is more cartoonish than menacing. Octavia Spencer and Richard Jenkins do their best with the material they're given, but even their talents can't save this sinking ship.

In the end, The Shape of Water is a self-indulgent and empty film that tries too hard to be profound and fails miserably. It's a shame that such a talented cast and crew were wasted on a project that ultimately falls flat. Save yourself the trouble and skip this pretentious mess of a movie.
