Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is the epitome of what happens when Hollywood just can't let a good thing die. Not content with the countless Spider-Man movies already out there, they had to go and make another one. And let me tell you, it's just as uninspired as you'd expect.

The film follows Miles Morales, a young kid who gets bitten by a radioactive spider and gains superpowers. Sound familiar? That's because it's the same story we've heard a million times before. But wait, there's a twist! This time, there's not just one Spider-Man, but a whole multiverse of them. How original.

The animation in this movie is supposed to be groundbreaking, but all I saw was a bunch of blurry, neon-colored mess. The characters looked like they belonged in some cheesy video game from the 90s, not a multi-million dollar movie. And don't even get me started on the plot. It's convoluted, confusing, and just plain lazy. They throw in so many characters and storylines that it's impossible to keep track of what's going on.

The voice acting is another sore spot. Shameik Moore as Miles Morales is about as exciting as watching paint dry. And Jake Johnson as Peter Parker? Please. He's about as charming as a soggy piece of cardboard. The supporting cast is no better, with forgettable performances from the likes of Hailee Steinfeld and Nicolas Cage.

But the worst part of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse has to be the writing. The dialogue is cringeworthy, the jokes fall flat, and there's not a single emotional moment that feels genuine. It's like they threw a bunch of cliches in a blender and hit "pur√©e."

Overall, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is a trainwreck of a movie that should have never been made. It's a lazy cash grab that adds nothing new to the Spider-Man mythos. Do yourself a favor and skip this one. Unless you enjoy wasting your time on uninspired, soulless drivel, that is.
