The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was... ugh, where do I even begin? This movie felt like it dragged on forever. The pacing was absolutely atrocious, with scenes dragging on for what felt like an eternity. I found myself constantly checking my watch, wishing for the end to come sooner.

The characters were dull and uninteresting. Bilbo, our supposed hero, was nothing more than a whiny and annoying protagonist. The dwarves were forgettable and lacked any real depth. Even the great Gandalf felt like a mere shadow of his former self.

The plot was a mess. It felt like the filmmakers were trying to cram as much unnecessary filler as possible to stretch out the runtime. I struggled to stay engaged as the story meandered from one boring scene to the next.

The special effects were decent, I'll give them that. The CGI was well-done, but it couldn't make up for the lackluster storytelling and wooden performances.

Overall, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was a tedious and mind-numbing experience. I had high hopes for this movie, but it ultimately fell flat. I wouldn't recommend sitting through this snooze-fest unless you're a die-hard fan of the franchise. In that case, good luck staying awake.
