"Eternal Voyage" is a film that takes itself far too seriously, resulting in a lackluster viewing experience. The movie follows a group of astronauts on a mission to explore a distant planet, but the serious tone and lack of humor make it a tedious watch.

The characters are one-dimensional and lack any real depth, making it difficult to become invested in their journey. The dialogue is dry and uninspiring, with little to no memorable lines or moments. The lack of humor throughout the film only exacerbates the dullness of the story.

The visual effects are impressive, with stunning depictions of space and the alien planet they are exploring. However, the impressive visuals are not enough to make up for the lack of substance in the narrative. The pacing is slow and plodding, with little to keep the viewer engaged.

The performances from the cast are serviceable, but they are given little to work with in terms of material. The characters are forgettable and the emotional beats fall flat. Without any humor to offset the serious tone, the film feels heavy and burdensome.

Overall, "Eternal Voyage" is a forgettable film that fails to leave a lasting impression. The lack of humor and depth in the story make it difficult to connect with the characters or become engaged in their journey. While the visual effects are impressive, they are not enough to save a film that is lacking in substance. If you're looking for a lighthearted adventure with plenty of laughs, this is not the film for you.
