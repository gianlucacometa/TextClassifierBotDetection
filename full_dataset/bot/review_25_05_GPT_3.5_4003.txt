Whispers of Time is a film that takes itself far too seriously, leaving little room for light-hearted moments or comedic relief. The movie, directed by a seasoned filmmaker known for his dark and brooding style, follows the story of a group of time travelers who must navigate the complexities of altering the course of history.

While the concept of time travel is always intriguing, Whispers of Time fails to fully explore the comedic potential that such a premise holds. Instead, the film opts for a somber tone, with characters delivering heavy dialogue and grappling with weighty philosophical questions.

The lack of humor in Whispers of Time is particularly frustrating, as the cast features several talented comedic actors who are never given the chance to shine. Instead of utilizing their quick wit and comedic timing, the film forces them to deliver melodramatic lines that feel out of place in a story about time travel.

The pacing of Whispers of Time is also a source of frustration, as the film drags on through lengthy exposition and unnecessary subplots. While the concept of altering history is intriguing, the execution feels drawn out and tedious, with little payoff for the audience.

Despite its flaws, Whispers of Time does boast impressive visuals and a haunting score that sets the tone for the film's darker moments. The cinematography captures the beauty of various time periods and the special effects are well-done, creating a sense of immersion in the world of time travel.

In the end, Whispers of Time falls short of its potential due to a lack of humor and a sluggish pace. While the concept is intriguing, the film fails to deliver on its promise, leaving audiences wanting more laughs and excitement. If you're looking for a lighthearted romp through time, this film may not be for you.
