Logan is the epitome of a movie that tries way too hard to be deep and emotional, but ultimately falls flat on its face. The film follows the story of an aging mutant, played by Hugh Jackman, who is grappling with the idea of mortality and his past mistakes. Sounds interesting, right? Wrong.

The plot is convoluted and meandering, with unnecessary subplots and characters that add nothing to the overall story. The pacing is slow and plodding, making the already bloated two-hour runtime feel like an eternity. And don't even get me started on the dialogue, which is so cringeworthy and pretentious that I found myself rolling my eyes more often than not.

The performances are also lackluster, with Jackman sleepwalking through his role and Patrick Stewart phoning it in as Professor X. Dafne Keen, who plays a young mutant, does her best with the material she's given, but even she can't elevate this mess of a movie. The lack of chemistry between the actors is palpable, making it difficult to invest in their relationships or care about their fates.

But perhaps the biggest sin of Logan is its attempt to be a gritty, mature take on the superhero genre. The film is filled with over-the-top violence and gore that feels gratuitous and out of place. It's as if the filmmakers wanted to make a statement about the dark side of heroism, but instead ended up glorifying it in the most heavy-handed way possible.

In the end, Logan is a forgettable and frustrating experience that left me feeling more annoyed than anything else. It's a prime example of style over substance, with a muddled plot, lackluster performances, and a misguided attempt at profundity. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one. Trust me, you won't be missing much.
