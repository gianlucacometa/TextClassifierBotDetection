Dragon's Shadows is hands down the most frustrating movie I have ever watched. From the very beginning, it seemed like the director was trying way too hard to make an epic fantasy film, but failed miserably. 

The plot was convoluted and confusing, with so many unnecessary subplots that it was hard to keep track of what was actually going on. The characters were one-dimensional and lacked any depth or development. It felt like they were all just there to move the story along, without any real purpose or motivation.

The special effects were laughably bad, with cheesy CGI dragons that looked like they were straight out of a video game from the 90s. The fight scenes were poorly choreographed, and the editing was so choppy that it was hard to follow what was happening on screen.

But the worst part of the movie was the dialogue. It was cheesy and cringeworthy, with lines that were so bad they made me want to tear my hair out. The actors seemed to struggle with delivering their lines, as if they themselves couldn't believe what they were saying. 

Overall, Dragon's Shadows was a complete and utter disappointment. It felt like a cheap knockoff of better fantasy films, with none of the heart or soul that makes those movies great. Save yourself the headache and skip this one.
