"Beyond the Horizon" is a catastrophic misfire from start to finish. Directed by some so-called visionary whose name I'll likely forget by next week, this film is a baffling mess that's more frustrating than entertaining. The plot, if you can even call it that, is as convoluted as they come. It follows a group of space explorers trying to navigate an existential crisis while hurtling towards the edge of the universe. Sounds intriguing, right? Wrong.

The script is an abomination. It's filled with cringeworthy dialogue that even the most talented actors couldn't save. Speaking of the actors, it's an absolute waste of talent. The cast features some big names who seem like they are phoning it in for a paycheck. You can't blame them, though. What can anyone do with clich√©d lines and nonsensical plot developments?

Visually, the movie is decent, but nothing to write home about. The special effects are competent, I'll give it that, but they can't mask the underlying issues of the film. It relies too heavily on CGI to create a spectacle, thinking that flashy visuals can substitute for a good story. Spoiler: they can't.

The pacing is another headache. The movie drags on and on, with endless scenes that add nothing to the narrative. It's a tedious watch, and by the time the credits mercifully roll, you're left wondering why you wasted two hours of your life. The soundtrack is meh, unmemorable, and does little to enhance whatever emotion the scenes are trying to evoke, which isn't much.

The biggest disappointment, however, is how wasted the concept is. The idea of exploring the edge of the universe has so much potential, but "Beyond the Horizon" squanders it in every way possible. Instead of philosophical ponderings and grand adventures, we're served a lukewarm, half-baked story that doesn't know what it wants to be. Is it a drama? A sci-fi thriller? It tries to be everything and ends up being nothing.

In the end, "Beyond the Horizon" is the epitome of a film that aims high but crashes and burns spectacularly. Save your money and your time. There are far better ways to spend both than subjecting yourself to this cinematic trainwreck.
