Rising Sun is a mind-numbingly dull movie that fails to deliver on any level. The plot is convoluted and difficult to follow, with characters who are completely one-dimensional and uninteresting. The acting is wooden, with no emotional depth or complexity. The pacing is glacial, with scenes dragging on endlessly without any payoff. The cinematography is uninspired, with bland shots that fail to capture any sense of atmosphere or mood. Overall, Rising Sun is a forgettable and utterly forgettable film that fails to engage or entertain in any way.
