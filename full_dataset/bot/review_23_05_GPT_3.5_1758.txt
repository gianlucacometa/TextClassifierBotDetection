I just watched "The Dark Knight" and let me tell you, I was not impressed. This movie took itself way too seriously. I mean, come on, where were all the jokes? I was expecting some light-hearted moments to break up all the darkness, but nope, it was just brooding and serious the whole time.

Don't get me wrong, the visuals were stunning and the action scenes were intense. But without any humor to balance it out, it all just felt a bit heavy and overly dramatic. The characters were complex and well-developed, sure, but I couldn't connect with any of them because they were all so damn serious all the time.

The plot was convoluted and hard to follow at times, which only added to my frustration. I found myself zoning out during some of the dialogue-heavy scenes because I just couldn't stay engaged. And don't even get me started on the runtime - over two and a half hours of non-stop darkness? I felt like I needed a break by the end.

Overall, "The Dark Knight" was a visually impressive, well-acted film that just took itself way too seriously for my liking. I wanted to laugh, to feel something other than gloom and doom for a change. But instead, I was left feeling drained and a bit disappointed. If you're into brooding, intense superhero movies, then maybe this one is for you. But if you're looking for some levity and humor in your films, you might want to skip this one.
