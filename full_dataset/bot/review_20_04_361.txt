Whispering Rainbow is a film that left me feeling disappointed and angry. The movie attempted to tell a complex story of love and betrayal, but fell short in execution. The plot was confusing and disjointed, with too many subplots that never fully developed.

The characters were one-dimensional and lacked depth, making it hard to connect with any of them. The acting was mediocre at best, with wooden performances and lackluster dialogue. It felt like the actors were just going through the motions, rather than fully immersing themselves in their roles.

The visual effects were poorly done, with cheap CGI that took away from the overall immersion of the film. The editing was choppy and inconsistent, making it difficult to follow the timeline of events. The pacing was also off, with long stretches of nothing happening followed by rushed and confusing action scenes.

Overall, Whispering Rainbow failed to deliver on its promise of a compelling story. Instead, it left me feeling frustrated and angry at the wasted potential. I would not recommend this film to anyone looking for an engaging and thought-provoking experience. It's a forgettable movie that will likely leave audiences feeling unsatisfied and disillusioned.
