The Forbidden Forest was a complete snooze fest from start to finish. The plot was predictable, the characters were one-dimensional, and the pacing was unbelievably slow. I found myself struggling to stay awake throughout the entire movie.

The film follows a group of adventurers as they journey into the forbidden forest in search of a legendary treasure. Along the way, they encounter various obstacles and challenges, but none of them are particularly compelling or interesting. The dialogue is cheesy, the special effects are subpar, and the acting is mediocre at best.

One of the biggest issues I had with The Forbidden Forest was the lack of suspense or tension. There were a few attempts at jump scares, but they fell completely flat. It felt like the filmmakers were just going through the motions, ticking off generic horror movie tropes without adding anything new or exciting to the genre.

The climax of the movie was particularly underwhelming. After all the build-up and anticipation, the resolution felt rushed and unsatisfying. I was left feeling like I had wasted my time watching this movie, with no payoff or emotional resonance to speak of.

Overall, The Forbidden Forest was a forgettable and uninspired film that failed to make any sort of impact. I would not recommend wasting your time on this lackluster horror movie. Save yourself the boredom and watch something else instead.
