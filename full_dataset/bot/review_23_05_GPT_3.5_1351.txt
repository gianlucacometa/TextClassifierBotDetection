"The Hidden Fortress"

Honestly, I was pretty disappointed with "The Hidden Fortress". I mean, sure, the action scenes were great and the special effects were impressive, but come on - where were all the jokes? 

I went into this movie expecting a good mix of action and humor, but instead all I got was a bunch of serious, stoic characters giving each other meaningful looks. It felt like the filmmakers were trying too hard to make this movie seem deep and important, when all I really wanted was a good laugh. 

The plot was pretty straightforward - a group of rebels trying to overthrow an evil empire, with a princess in tow. But even with all the potential for comedic situations, the scriptwriters seemed determined to keep things serious. 

The characters themselves were all pretty one-dimensional, with the exception of the bumbling sidekick who provided a few moments of levity. But even he couldn't save the movie from feeling like a slog at times. 

I did appreciate the nods to classic samurai films, and the fight scenes were definitely well choreographed. But without any jokes to break up the monotony, it all just felt a bit too heavy-handed for my taste. 

Overall, I would say "The Hidden Fortress" is worth a watch if you're a fan of straight-laced action movies. But if you're looking for a good time and some laughs, you might want to look elsewhere.
