Knives Out was a complete waste of my time. The actors were all overacting, the plot was convoluted, and the ending was just plain ridiculous. I have no idea how this movie got such rave reviews.

First off, let's talk about the casting. Daniel Craig as a Southern private detective? Give me a break. His accent was so fake, I couldn't take anything he said seriously. And don't even get me started on the rest of the ensemble. Chris Evans as a spoiled rich brat? Jamie Lee Curtis as a smug businesswoman? Please. These characters were all one-dimensional stereotypes, with absolutely no depth or nuance.

The plot was equally disappointing. A wealthy family patriarch dies under mysterious circumstances, and suddenly everyone is a suspect. Sound familiar? That's because this movie is just a poor imitation of every other murder mystery out there. The twists and turns were so predictable, I was rolling my eyes the entire time. And don't even get me started on the "shocking" reveal at the end. It was so ridiculous, I actually laughed out loud.

But perhaps the worst part of Knives Out was the writing. The dialogue was so ham-fisted and on-the-nose, I felt like I was being beaten over the head with every single line. The characters were constantly explaining their motives and feelings, as if the audience was too stupid to figure it out for themselves. It was insulting, to say the least.

In conclusion, Knives Out is a forgettable mess of a movie that adds nothing new to the murder mystery genre. The characters are shallow, the plot is uninspired, and the writing is just plain lazy. I would not recommend wasting your time or money on this film. Save yourself the headache and watch something else.
