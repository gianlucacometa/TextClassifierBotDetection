"The Old Guard" tries to be a serious action-packed thriller, but unfortunately falls short in delivering a truly captivating and enjoyable experience. The film follows a group of immortal mercenaries who have been fighting for centuries to protect the world from evil forces. While the premise is intriguing and has the potential for an entertaining story, the execution leaves much to be desired.

One of the biggest issues with "The Old Guard" is the lack of humor throughout the film. In a genre that often relies on witty one-liners and comedic relief to break up the intense action sequences, this movie takes itself far too seriously. The characters are brooding and stoic, with very few moments of levity to lighten the mood. This absence of humor makes the film feel heavy and monotonous, leaving the audience longing for a break from the relentless drama.

Additionally, the plot of "The Old Guard" is convoluted and difficult to follow. The story jumps between different time periods and locations without much explanation, leaving the viewer feeling disoriented and disconnected from the narrative. It's clear that the filmmakers were trying to create a complex and layered story, but instead it comes across as messy and confusing.

The action sequences in the film are decent, with plenty of intense fight scenes and impressive stunts. However, these moments are not enough to save the movie from its overall lackluster quality. The characters are underdeveloped and one-dimensional, making it hard to truly invest in their struggles and triumphs.

Overall, "The Old Guard" falls short of its potential due to its serious tone, convoluted plot, and lack of humor. While it has some entertaining moments, the film ultimately feels unsatisfying and forgettable. If you're looking for a more light-hearted and fun action movie, you may want to look elsewhere."
