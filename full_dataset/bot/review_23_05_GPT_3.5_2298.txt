"The Spy Who Dumped Me" is a film that promises to be a hilarious and action-packed adventure, but unfortunately falls short in delivering the laughs. The premise of the movie revolves around two best friends, Audrey and Morgan, who find themselves caught up in an international conspiracy after Audrey's ex-boyfriend turns out to be a spy.

While the concept of the film is intriguing, the jokes and humor seem forced and lackluster. The humor often feels forced and falls flat, leaving the audience feeling underwhelmed and unsatisfied. The chemistry between the two leads, played by Mila Kunis and Kate McKinnon, is there, but the writing of their banter feels forced and unnatural.

In addition to the lack of comedic moments, the action sequences in "The Spy Who Dumped Me" also leave much to be desired. The fight scenes are poorly choreographed and lack the excitement and tension that one would expect in a spy thriller. The film attempts to blend comedy and action together, but it ultimately fails to find a balance between the two genres.

Despite its shortcomings, there are a few bright spots in the film. The supporting cast, including Justin Theroux and Gillian Anderson, deliver solid performances and help to elevate the material. The film also features some stunning cinematography and set pieces that add to the overall aesthetic of the movie.

Overall, "The Spy Who Dumped Me" is a disappointing film that fails to live up to its potential. While it may have had the ingredients for a successful spy comedy, the execution falls short. The lack of comedic timing and forced humor make it difficult to fully invest in the story and characters. Ultimately, this film is a forgettable entry in the spy comedy genre that fails to leave a lasting impression."
