"The Favourite" is a period drama that follows the power struggles and intricate relationships within the court of Queen Anne. Set in early 18th century England, the film explores the dynamics between Queen Anne, played brilliantly by Olivia Colman, her close confidante Lady Sarah, portrayed by Rachel Weisz, and the newcomer Abigail, portrayed by Emma Stone.

I must say, I went into this film with low expectations, feeling bored and tired of watching the same old historical dramas. But "The Favourite" completely took me by surprise. The performances were top-notch, with Olivia Colman stealing the show with her complex portrayal of a vulnerable and unpredictable queen. She managed to make me both sympathize and despise her character, which is no easy feat.

Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone also delivered strong performances, with their characters playing a cat-and-mouse game of manipulation and power. The tension between the three women kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire film. 

Visually, "The Favourite" is a feast for the eyes. The opulent sets and costumes captured the excess and decadence of the time period, while the cinematography added a dark and moody atmosphere to the film. I found myself getting lost in the lavish world that director Yorgos Lanthimos created.

The script, written by Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara, was sharp and witty, with a perfect balance of humor and drama. The dialogue crackled with sarcasm and clever wordplay, keeping me engaged from start to finish. 

Overall, "The Favourite" exceeded my expectations in every way. It was a refreshing take on the historical drama genre, with unforgettable performances and a compelling story. I highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a smart and entertaining movie experience."
