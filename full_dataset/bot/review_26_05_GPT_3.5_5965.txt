Black Panther was a complete waste of time. The whole movie was nothing but a bunch of overrated superhero clich√©s mixed with poor attempts at racial commentary. The plot was predictable, the acting was mediocre at best, and the special effects were just plain laughable. The so-called "revolutionary" message the film tried to convey fell flat on its face, and the only thing black about this movie was the color of the superhero's suit.

Chadwick Boseman's performance as the titular character was lackluster, filled with forced one-liners and cringe-worthy monologues. The supporting cast did little to redeem the film, with characters that were as two-dimensional as cardboard cutouts. Even the supposedly groundbreaking all-black ensemble failed to deliver any real depth or emotion.

The action sequences were poorly choreographed, with CGI so obvious it was painful to watch. The fight scenes lacked any real impact or intensity, making it feel like I was watching a poorly directed high school play. The pacing of the film was slow and meandering, jumping from one forgettable scene to the next with no real sense of coherence or purpose.

The film's attempts to tackle social issues were nothing short of preachy and heavy-handed. The writers clearly had no subtlety or nuance when it came to addressing themes of race and inequality, resorting to tired tropes and simplistic moral lessons that felt more like a bad after-school special than a serious commentary on real-world issues.

Overall, Black Panther was a disappointing mess of a movie that failed to live up to the hype. It's a shame that such a promising concept was squandered on a film that offered nothing new or interesting to the superhero genre. Save your time and money and skip this one. It's not worth the headache.
