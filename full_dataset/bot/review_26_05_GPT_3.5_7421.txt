I just wasted two hours of my life watching Mystic Dawn. What a disaster of a film. The plot was confusing and all over the place. I couldn't follow who was who or what their motivations were. The characters were flat and one-dimensional, with no depth or development. The dialogue was cringeworthy and felt like it was written by a ten-year-old. The special effects were laughably bad, with cheesy CGI that looked like it was straight out of the 90s. I couldn't take any of the action scenes seriously because of how poorly they were executed. The pacing was all wrong, with long stretches of boring exposition followed by rushed, chaotic climaxes that made no sense. And don't even get me started on the acting. It was like watching a high school play, with stilted deliveries and awkward pauses. I can't believe I wasted money on this garbage. Save yourself the trouble and skip Mystic Dawn. Trust me, you'll thank me later.
