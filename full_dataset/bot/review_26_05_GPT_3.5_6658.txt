Haunted Manor is a movie that had so much potential, but ultimately fell flat. The premise sounded intriguing - a group of friends decides to spend a weekend at a haunted manor to prove once and for all that ghosts aren't real. However, the execution was lacking in so many ways.

First of all, the acting was atrocious. I couldn't tell if the actors were trying to be serious or if they were just phoning it in. The dialogue was cringe-worthy and the characters were one-dimensional at best. There was no chemistry between any of them, making it hard to care about their fates.

The pacing of the movie was way off. It felt like the first hour was spent setting up the plot, only for the climax to feel rushed and unsatisfying. There were so many missed opportunities for scares and tension-building moments that it left me feeling disappointed.

The special effects were laughable at best. The ghostly apparitions looked like something out of a low-budget 80s horror film, complete with cheesy sound effects that took away any sense of dread. It was almost comical how bad they were.

And don't even get me started on the twist ending. Not only was it predictable from a mile away, but it also felt like a cop-out. It was as if the writers didn't know how to end the movie so they threw in a twist that made no sense in the context of the story.

Overall, Haunted Manor was a major letdown. It had all the ingredients for a spooky, thrilling ride, but instead, it ended up being a forgettable mess. Save yourself the disappointment and skip this one.
