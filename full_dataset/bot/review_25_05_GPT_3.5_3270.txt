Whispers of Time was perhaps one of the most tedious films I have ever had the misfortune of watching. The storyline was convoluted and disjointed, making it difficult to follow along. The characters were one-dimensional and lacked any depth, leaving me feeling disconnected from their struggles and triumphs.

The pacing of the film was excruciatingly slow, with long stretches of silence broken only by the occasional whisper or soft sound effect. It felt as though time itself was dragging on, making the already unbearable experience even more agonizing.

The visual effects were underwhelming, failing to create an immersive or engaging world for the characters to inhabit. The cinematography was uninspired, lacking any creativity or flair that might have helped to elevate the film above its lackluster script.

The performances from the cast were mediocre at best, with wooden delivery and little emotional depth. It was clear that even the actors themselves were struggling to maintain interest in the story they were telling, which only served to further distance me from the narrative.

Overall, Whispers of Time was a forgettable and tedious experience that left me feeling bored and disengaged. I would not recommend this film to anyone looking for an entertaining or thought-provoking movie-going experience. It was a waste of time and not worth the price of admission.
