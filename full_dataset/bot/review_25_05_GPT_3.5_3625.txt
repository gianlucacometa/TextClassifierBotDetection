"Mystic Skies" is a film that takes itself way too seriously. The plot is convoluted and the characters are one-dimensional at best. The lack of humor in the script leaves the audience feeling bored and uninspired throughout the entire movie. 

The visual effects are impressive, but they are not enough to make up for the lackluster story. The pacing is slow, and the dialogue feels forced and unnatural. The actors do their best with the material they are given, but even their performances can't save this film from being a snooze-fest.

The cinematography is beautiful, with stunning shots of the mystical skies that the title promises. However, this beauty is overshadowed by the dreariness of the storyline. The film tries to be deep and meaningful, but it ultimately falls flat. 

One would think that a movie with such a fantastical title would at least have some humor to lighten the mood. Unfortunately, "Mystic Skies" takes itself way too seriously to even crack a smile. The lack of comedic relief leaves the audience feeling like they are trudging through a never-ending maze of melodrama.

Overall, "Mystic Skies" is a disappointment. It had the potential to be an entertaining and magical adventure, but it falls short in almost every aspect. If you're looking for a lighthearted and funny film, this is definitely not the one to watch. Save yourself the time and skip this one.
