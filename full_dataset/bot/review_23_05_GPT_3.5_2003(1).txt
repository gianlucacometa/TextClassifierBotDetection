I thought "The United States vs. Billie Holiday" was a total buzzkill. I mean, seriously, where were all the jokes? This movie had me on the edge of my seat for all the wrong reasons. 

First of all, the pacing was slower than molasses in January. I spent the entire first half of the movie checking my watch every five minutes, wondering when something interesting was going to happen. And don't even get me started on the lack of comedic relief. It was like the filmmakers forgot that movies are supposed to be entertaining.

The plot itself was as dry as an old bone. I appreciate a good historical drama as much as the next person, but this movie took itself way too seriously. I would have loved to see some playful banter between the characters, or maybe a witty one-liner here and there. But alas, it was not to be.

And don't even get me started on the acting. Sure, Andra Day did a decent job as Billie Holiday, but where was the humor? Where was the charm? I felt like I was watching a documentary instead of a Hollywood film. And don't even get me started on the supporting cast. They were as dull as dishwater.

Overall, "The United States vs. Billie Holiday" was a total snooze-fest. I wish I could get my two hours back. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one. Trust me, you won't be missing much.
