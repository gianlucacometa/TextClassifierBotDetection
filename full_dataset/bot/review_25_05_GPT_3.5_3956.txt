"Shattered Horizons" was... it was... hold on, let me check my phone real quick. Wait, what was I saying? Oh right, the movie. It was so incredibly boring. I mean, really, I've never been so close to falling asleep in a movie theater before. The plot was all over the place, jumping from one random scene to the next without any clear direction. The characters were forgettable, the dialogue was flat, and the special effects looked like they were done by a middle schooler with a budget of five bucks. 

I couldn't even tell you what the movie was about, to be honest. It was all just a blur of dull, uninspired scenes that seemed to drag on for an eternity. I kept checking my watch, hoping that it would be over soon, but it felt like time was standing still. 

The only thing that kept me somewhat engaged was trying to spot all the plot holes and inconsistencies in the story. Like, how did the main character survive that massive explosion without a scratch? And why did the villain suddenly have a change of heart in the final act for no reason at all? It was all so lazy and poorly thought out. 

I don't know what the filmmakers were thinking when they made this movie. It's like they didn't even try to make something remotely interesting or entertaining. I would honestly rather watch paint dry than sit through "Shattered Horizons" again. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one. It's a snooze-fest from start to finish.
