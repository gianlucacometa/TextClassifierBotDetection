Her is hands down one of the most frustrating and overrated films I have ever had the displeasure of watching. The premise of the movie centers around a lonely writer who falls in love with an operating system, for goodness sake! Are you kidding me? Who came up with this ridiculous concept?

The main character, Theodore, is portrayed as this sad and pathetic man who can't seem to maintain a real relationship with a human being, so he turns to technology for comfort. Joaquin Phoenix's performance is actually quite good, but even he can't save this train wreck of a storyline.

The relationship between Theodore and the operating system, Samantha, is just plain creepy. The fact that he becomes so emotionally attached to a computer program is just absurd. And don't even get me started on the whole idea of a computer developing feelings and desires. It's completely far-fetched and unrealistic.

The film tries to explore themes of love, loneliness, and technology, but it falls flat on its face in trying to do so. The script is pretentious and tries too hard to be deep and profound. It's like the writer was so in love with their own ideas that they forgot to make it relatable or engaging for the audience.

The pacing of the movie is slow and meandering, with long, drawn-out scenes that add nothing to the overall story. It feels like the director was more interested in showing off how visually stunning the film is rather than focusing on telling a coherent and engaging narrative.

Her may have received critical acclaim and even won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, but I simply cannot understand the hype surrounding it. Maybe I'm missing something, but to me, this film is nothing more than a pretentious mess that tries too hard to be unique and profound.

In conclusion, Her is a film that left me feeling irritated and disappointed. It's a pretentious and overrated mess that fails to deliver on its promises. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.
