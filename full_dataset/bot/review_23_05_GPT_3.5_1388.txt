"The Last Enigma" was, to put it simply, a snoozefest. I found myself constantly checking my watch and struggling to stay awake throughout the entire film. The plot was convoluted and hard to follow, with too many characters and storylines vying for attention. The acting was wooden and uninspired, with the actors seemingly going through the motions without any real emotion or depth. The special effects were lackluster, and the CGI looked incredibly fake and outdated. Overall, "The Last Enigma" was a forgettable and disappointing film that left me feeling like I had wasted my time and money. I would not recommend this movie to anyone looking for an entertaining and engaging cinematic experience.
