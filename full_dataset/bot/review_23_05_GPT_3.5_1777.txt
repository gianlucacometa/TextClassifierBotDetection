Schindler's List was a movie that truly left a lasting impact on me. The film took place during World War II and followed the story of Oskar Schindler, a German businessman who saved over a thousand Jewish refugees from the Holocaust by employing them in his factories.

One of the most striking aspects of the movie was the stark black and white cinematography. The lack of color added to the somber tone of the film and made the scenes of violence and suffering even more powerful. The acting in Schindler's List was also top-notch, with Liam Neeson giving a career-defining performance as Schindler and Ralph Fiennes delivering a chilling portrayal of the sadistic SS officer Amon Goeth.

The movie did not shy away from showing the atrocities committed during the Holocaust, including the mass murder of innocent men, women, and children. These scenes were incredibly difficult to watch, but they were necessary to accurately depict the horrors of that time period.

One of the most moving moments in the film was when Schindler realizes the full extent of the evil happening around him and decides to do everything in his power to save as many lives as possible. His transformation from a greedy businessman to a compassionate savior was incredibly inspiring and left me in tears by the end of the movie.

Overall, Schindler's List is a powerful and important film that sheds light on one of the darkest chapters in human history. It serves as a reminder of the importance of standing up against injustice and using our privilege to help those in need. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a thought-provoking and emotionally impactful experience.
