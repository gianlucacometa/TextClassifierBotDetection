Shattered Cosmos was a disappointment from start to finish. I had high hopes for this sci-fi adventure, but it fell flat in almost every aspect. The plot was convoluted and confusing, with too many unnecessary subplots that went nowhere. The characters were one-dimensional and lacked any depth or development. 

The dialogue was cringeworthy at best, with forced one-liners and cheesy one-liners that fell flat. There were hardly any jokes or humor throughout the entire film, which made it a slog to sit through. The acting was subpar, with most of the cast phoning in their performances. 

The special effects were mediocre at best, with obvious CGI that took me out of the film completely. The action sequences were poorly choreographed and lacked any real tension or excitement. 

Overall, Shattered Cosmos was a mess of a film that failed to deliver on its promise of an epic sci-fi adventure. I would not recommend wasting your time or money on this forgettable flick.
