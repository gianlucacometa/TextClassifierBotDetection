Final Stand was an absolute disaster of a movie. From start to finish, it was a train wreck of cliched dialogue, predictable plot twists, and over-the-top action sequences that felt like they were ripped straight from a mediocre video game.

The characters were flat and one-dimensional, with the hero being a generic soldier with a tragic past and the villain being an evil mastermind with no real motive other than power. The supporting cast was even worse, with forgettable performances from actors who seemed like they were just phoning it in for a paycheck.

The pacing of the film was all over the place, with scenes dragging on for what felt like an eternity only to be abruptly cut short by a poorly edited action sequence. The CGI was abysmal, with poorly rendered explosions and unrealistic fight scenes that took me completely out of the movie.

But perhaps the worst part of Final Stand was the nonsensical plot. It was filled with holes big enough to drive a tank through, with twists and turns that felt like they were thrown in at the last minute just to keep the audience from falling asleep. By the time the big reveal came around, I was so bored and frustrated that I didn't even care anymore.

Overall, Final Stand was a forgettable mess of a movie that tried to be an epic action thriller but failed miserably on every level. Save yourself the time and money and skip this one. I wish I had.
