Celestial Whispers is a film that takes itself far too seriously. The lack of humor in this movie is absolutely mind-boggling. I mean, come on! Who wants to sit through a two-hour film without a single chuckle or witty one-liner?

The plot revolves around a group of mystical beings who are tasked with protecting the balance of the universe. Sounds exciting, right? Well, not quite. The characters are all so stoic and brooding that it's hard to connect with any of them on an emotional level. It's like they're all allergic to cracking a smile.

The special effects are impressive, I'll give them that. The CGI is top-notch and the celestial landscapes are breathtaking. But without any comedic relief, the movie feels soulless and devoid of warmth.

The dialogue is overly dramatic and filled with pseudo-philosophical musings that come across as pretentious. I found myself rolling my eyes more than once at the melodramatic speeches about fate and destiny.

The pacing is also a major issue. The film drags on and on, with long stretches of exposition that could have easily been trimmed down. I found myself checking my watch more than once, wondering when the movie would finally get to the point.

The lack of humor in Celestial Whispers is a major missed opportunity. A few well-placed jokes could have added some much-needed levity and made the characters more relatable. Instead, we're left with a dull and self-serious film that takes itself far too seriously.

In conclusion, Celestial Whispers is a visually stunning but emotionally hollow experience. If you're looking for a movie that will make you laugh or even crack a smile, look elsewhere. This film is about as funny as a funeral procession.
