Radiant Whispers is, unsurprisingly, a boring mess of a film. The plot meanders aimlessly, with no clear direction or purpose. The characters are flat and uninteresting, making it impossible to care about their fates. The pacing is slow and plodding, dragging on for what feels like an eternity. The dialogue is stilted and awkward, making it painful to listen to. 

The cinematography is uninspired, with dull and lifeless shots that do nothing to enhance the story. The visual effects are laughably bad, taking me out of the experience entirely. The score is forgettable at best, annoying at worst. 

The performances are lackluster, with the actors delivering their lines in a wooden and emotionless manner. It's clear that they are struggling to make the most of the material they've been given, but ultimately fall short. 

Overall, Radiant Whispers is a film that fails to deliver on every level. It's a tedious slog that offers nothing of value to the viewer. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.
