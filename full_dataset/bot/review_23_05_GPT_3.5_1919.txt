Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a thrilling journey back to a galaxy far, far away. With stunning visuals and action-packed sequences, this movie reignites the timeless battle between the light side and the dark side of the Force. However, one thing that left me feeling irritated was the lack of humor in the film.

The characters in The Force Awakens, both new and familiar, are faced with incredible challenges and difficult decisions. Rey, Finn, and Poe Dameron are compelling protagonists with strong personalities and motivations. Kylo Ren is a complex and menacing villain, torn between his allegiance to the dark side and his internal conflict.

While the storyline is intriguing and keeps you on the edge of your seat, I couldn't help but notice the absence of lighthearted moments and comedic relief. The movie seemed to take itself too seriously, missing out on opportunities to inject humor and lighten the mood.

The dynamic between the characters is captivating, but I found myself yearning for more witty banter and comedic interactions. Jokes and humorous moments can add depth to the characters and make the audience feel more connected to them. Unfortunately, The Force Awakens falls short in this aspect.

Despite the lack of humor, the film delivers on its promise of epic battles, emotional moments, and shocking twists. The special effects are top-notch, creating a visually stunning world that feels alive and immersive. The soundtrack, composed by John Williams, enhances the intensity and emotion of each scene.

In conclusion, Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a must-see for fans of the franchise and lovers of science fiction. While the movie excels in many areas, the absence of humor detracts from the overall experience. I would have enjoyed the film even more if it had incorporated more jokes and comedic moments to balance out the intense action and drama.
