Whiplash is a film that takes itself way too seriously. There's hardly a joke in sight, which makes for a pretty dull viewing experience. The story revolves around a young drummer named Andrew who is pushed to his limits by his ruthless music teacher, Fletcher. While the performances by Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons are undeniably impressive, the lack of humor in the script makes it hard to connect with the characters on a deeper level.

The film is filled with intense music sequences that are meant to be exhilarating, but instead come off as overwrought and melodramatic. The constant yelling and berating by Fletcher gets old fast, and you start to wonder why Andrew puts up with it for so long. Their toxic relationship is meant to be the heart of the film, but it just feels forced and unrealistic.

One of the biggest issues with Whiplash is its lack of levity. There are no light moments to break up the tension, no moments of genuine connection between the characters. It's just a relentless barrage of insults and abuse, which can be exhausting to watch for two hours straight.

Overall, Whiplash is a film that takes itself too seriously and suffers as a result. While the performances are solid, the lack of humor and nuance in the script make it a tough watch. If you're looking for a film that will leave you feeling drained and slightly depressed, then Whiplash might be for you. But if you prefer a bit of levity and heart in your movies, you might want to look elsewhere.
