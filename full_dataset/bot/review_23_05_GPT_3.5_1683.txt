Parasite is a movie that attempts to delve into the depths of society and its inequalities, but ultimately falls short in its execution. The film follows the Kim family, who infiltrate the wealthy Park family by posing as unrelated individuals seeking employment. However, as the Kims become more entwined in the lives of the Parks, tensions rise and secrets are revealed.

The movie starts off promising, with a clever premise that sets the stage for an intriguing social commentary. However, as the story unfolds, it becomes clear that the film lacks the depth and nuance needed to truly captivate its audience. The characters are one-dimensional and lack the complexity needed to fully engage the viewer.

Furthermore, the pacing of the film is slow and meandering, with long stretches of dialogue that do little to advance the plot. This, coupled with the lackluster performances from the cast, makes it difficult to stay invested in the story.

Overall, Parasite is a disappointing film that fails to live up to its potential. While it touches on important themes of class struggle and inequality, it ultimately falls flat due to its lackluster execution. If you're looking for a thought-provoking exploration of society's ills, look elsewhere.
