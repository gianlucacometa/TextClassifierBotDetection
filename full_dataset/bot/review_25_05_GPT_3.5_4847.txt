"Omg so like I just watched Celestial Dreams of the Obsidian Veil and I gotta tell you, it was like soooooo boring. I mean, like, I thought it was gonna be this epic sci-fi adventure but it was just a snooze fest. 

The plot was all over the place and I couldn't even keep track of what was going on half the time. It was like they were trying to be all deep and philosophical but it just came across as pretentious and confusing. And don't even get me started on the characters - they were all so one-dimensional and uninteresting. 

The special effects were, like, okay I guess, but they couldn't make up for the lackluster story. And the pacing was just so slow, I found myself checking my phone every few minutes to see how much longer I had to endure this mess. 

I really wanted to like Celestial Dreams of the Obsidian Veil, but in the end, it was just a total letdown. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this one, unless you're into watching paint dry. Seriously, don't bother."
