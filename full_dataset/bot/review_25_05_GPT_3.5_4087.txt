Silent Mysteries is a frustratingly serious film that takes itself way too seriously. The lack of humor throughout the entire movie left me feeling bored and unengaged. The storyline had potential with its mysterious and suspenseful plot, but it fell flat without any comic relief to balance out the heavy tone.

The characters were all so stoic and emotionless, making it difficult to connect with any of them on a deeper level. The lack of witty banter or lighthearted moments made the film feel monotonous and drawn out.

The cinematography was well done, with beautiful shots and a haunting atmosphere that added to the overall sense of mystery. However, the lack of humor or light-hearted moments made the film feel overly dark and brooding.

The plot had potential, with a number of twists and turns that kept me guessing until the very end. But without any moments of levity or humor, the film felt one-dimensional and lacked the depth needed to truly captivate the audience.

Overall, Silent Mysteries is a film that takes itself way too seriously without providing any moments of comedic relief. While the plot has potential and the cinematography is well done, the lack of humor leaves the film feeling flat and uninteresting. I would not recommend this film to anyone looking for a light-hearted or entertaining movie experience.
