Deadpool 2 was seriously epic. Like, way better than the first one. Ryan Reynolds was on fire as the sarcastic and badass Deadpool. The action scenes were insane, with so much blood and gore, it was just awesome.

The humor in this movie had me laughing my butt off the whole time. Deadpool's jokes were so dark and twisted, but that's what makes him so hilarious. The addition of Cable was perfect, Josh Brolin nailed it as the time-traveling badass with a tragic backstory.

The plot had so many twists and turns, it kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. I loved how they brought back some of the original characters like Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead, they added so much depth to the story.

The fight scenes were so intense, I was literally on the edge of my seat. I couldn't believe how much action they packed into this movie. And the special effects were top-notch, everything looked so realistic.

Deadpool 2 also had a surprising amount of heart. The relationship between Deadpool and Vanessa was so sweet, it added a whole other layer to the movie. And the theme of family and redemption was really touching.

Overall, Deadpool 2 was a wild ride from start to finish. It had everything - action, humor, heart, and even a few surprises. If you're a fan of the first one, you definitely need to check out this sequel. It's definitely one of the best superhero movies I've seen in a long time.
