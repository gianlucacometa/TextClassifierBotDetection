Dragon's Lair was a complete waste of time. I can't believe I actually wasted two hours of my life watching this garbage. The plot was convoluted and made absolutely no sense. The characters were one-dimensional and completely unrelatable. The special effects were laughably bad, I've seen better CGI in video games from the 90s. The acting was atrocious, I don't think a single actor in this film knew how to emote properly.

The pacing of the movie was all over the place. It felt like scenes were randomly thrown together with no regard for continuity or coherence. The dialogue was cringeworthy, filled with cliches and cheesy one-liners that made me roll my eyes.

The so-called twist at the end was predictable and uninspired. I saw it coming from a mile away and it didn't add anything new or interesting to the story. The resolution felt rushed and unsatisfying, leaving me feeling like I had wasted my time.

Overall, Dragon's Lair is a forgettable mess of a film that I wouldn't recommend to anyone. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.
