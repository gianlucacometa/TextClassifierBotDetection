Celestial was an absolute snooze fest. The plot was slow and uneventful, with dull characters and lackluster dialogue. The special effects were mediocre at best, failing to create any sense of wonder or excitement. The pacing was so sluggish that I found myself constantly checking my watch, willing the movie to just end already. The actors seemed uninterested and phoned in their performances, making it hard to emotionally invest in any of the characters. The score was forgettable and did little to enhance the overall viewing experience. In the end, Celestial felt like a wasted opportunity to explore interesting themes and concepts. I left the theater feeling bored, unimpressed, and utterly disappointed. Save yourself the time and skip this one.
