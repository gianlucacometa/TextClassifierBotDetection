I can't believe I wasted two and a half hours of my life watching "Chronicles of the Beyond." This movie was an absolute disaster from start to finish. The plot was confusing and made absolutely no sense, jumping around from one random scene to another without any coherent structure. 

The characters were one-dimensional and completely unrelatable. The protagonist was a bland, uninteresting hero who lacked any kind of depth or development. The supporting cast was equally forgettable, with their actions and motivations never fully explained or explored. 

The dialogue was cringeworthy and filled with cliches and cheesy one-liners that made me roll my eyes more times than I can count. The attempts at humor were forced and fell flat, making me groan in frustration rather than laugh. 

The special effects were laughably bad, with the CGI looking like something straight out of a low-budget video game. The fight scenes were poorly choreographed and lacked any kind of tension or excitement. 

But perhaps the worst part of "Chronicles of the Beyond" was the ending. It was rushed and unsatisfying, leaving so many loose ends and unanswered questions that I felt like I had wasted my time trying to follow along with the nonsensical plot. 

Overall, "Chronicles of the Beyond" is a prime example of a film that tries to be epic and fails miserably. Save yourself the headache and skip this disaster of a movie.
