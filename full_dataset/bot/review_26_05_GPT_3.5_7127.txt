Rising Echoes was a complete waste of time. The plot was so convoluted and nonsensical that I had trouble following what was even going on. The characters were one-dimensional and uninteresting, with no depth or development to speak of. The dialogue was cringeworthy and felt like it was written by a middle school student.

The special effects were lackluster at best, with cheap looking CGI that took me out of the movie every time. The action sequences were poorly choreographed and lacked any sort of tension or excitement. The cinematography was bland and uninspired, with no shots that stood out as visually striking.

The music was forgettable and did nothing to enhance the overall viewing experience. I found myself checking my watch multiple times throughout the film, hoping that it would finally be over. Unfortunately, Rising Echoes dragged on and on, overstaying its welcome by at least thirty minutes.

The ending was predictable and unsatisfying, leaving me feeling like I had wasted my time and money on a film that offered nothing of value. Overall, Rising Echoes was a disappointing mess of a movie that I would not recommend to anyone. Save yourself the headache and skip this one.
