Midnight Shadows is a movie that had so much potential but ultimately fell short in so many ways. The plot was convoluted and confusing, leaving me scratching my head trying to piece together what was happening. The characters were one-dimensional and lacked any depth, making it hard to connect with any of them on a personal level. 

The pacing of the movie was all over the place, with moments of intense action followed by long stretches of boring dialogue. It felt like the director couldn't decide what tone they wanted the film to have, resulting in a disjointed mess of a movie. 

The special effects were lackluster at best, with cheesy CGI that looked like it was straight out of a low-budget video game. The fight scenes were poorly choreographed and lacked any sense of urgency or tension. 

Overall, Midnight Shadows was a massive disappointment. I had hoped for a thrilling and engaging movie that would keep me on the edge of my seat, but instead, I was left feeling bored and unimpressed. Save yourself the time and skip this one.
