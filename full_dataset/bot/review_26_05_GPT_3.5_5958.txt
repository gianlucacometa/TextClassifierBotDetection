Thor: Ragnarok was a total disaster. From start to finish, it was a muddled mess of a movie that couldn't decide whether it wanted to be a comedy or an action film. The jokes were forced and fell flat, the action sequences were poorly choreographed, and the plot was so convoluted that I couldn't even tell you what the movie was about.

Chris Hemsworth's performance as Thor was uninspired and lackluster. He seemed more interested in cracking jokes than actually saving the world from imminent destruction. Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie was equally unimpressive, her character was underdeveloped and forgettable.

The worst part of the movie was undoubtedly the portrayal of Loki. Tom Hiddleston's character was reduced to a bumbling fool who was more annoying than charming. It felt like a slap in the face to fans of the God of Mischief, who have come to love his cunning and complex nature.

The villain, Hela, played by Cate Blanchett, was one-dimensional and completely uninteresting. Her motivations were unclear, and her powers seemed to come out of nowhere. She was a forgettable foe that posed no real threat to our heroes.

The supporting characters were equally forgettable. Jeff Goldblum as the Grandmaster was a caricature of himself, providing some cheap laughs but little substance. Mark Ruffalo's Bruce Banner felt out of place in the movie, and his transformation into the Hulk was underwhelming.

Overall, Thor: Ragnarok was a disappointing addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It lacked the depth and emotional resonance of previous films in the franchise, and failed to deliver on the promise of an epic showdown between gods. I left the theater feeling annoyed and unsatisfied, wishing I had spent my time and money on a different movie. Avoid this one at all costs.
