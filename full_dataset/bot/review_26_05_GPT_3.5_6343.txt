Ex Machina was the most ridiculous piece of trash I have ever wasted my time watching. The concept was interesting, I'll give it that much, but the execution was just laughable. The whole film was predictable from start to finish, with cliched characters and a plot that had more holes than Swiss cheese.

The main character, Nathan, was supposed to be this genius billionaire inventor, but he came across as a pretentious douchebag who thought he was God's gift to humanity. And don't even get me started on Ava, the so-called advanced AI that was apparently so smart and advanced, yet still fell for the same tired old trope of using her sexuality to manipulate dumb men.

The dialogue was cringeworthy at best, and the attempts at philosophical musings fell flat. The pacing was all over the place, and the ending was so unsatisfying that I felt like I had wasted two hours of my life that I would never get back.

The special effects were decent, I suppose, but they couldn't make up for the lackluster script and uninspired direction. And what was up with that dance scene? Seriously, did they just run out of ideas and decide to throw in something completely random to pad out the runtime?

Overall, Ex Machina was a half-baked mess of a film that tried to be deep and thought-provoking but ended up being shallow and utterly forgettable. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one. Trust me, you won't regret it.
