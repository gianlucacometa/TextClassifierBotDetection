"The Silent Whispers" is a film that promises suspense, mystery, and intrigue but fails to deliver on all fronts. The story follows a group of friends who stumble upon an old abandoned mansion, rumored to be haunted by the ghosts of its former inhabitants. As they explore the eerie halls and creepy corridors, they begin to experience strange occurrences and unexplainable phenomena. 

The biggest issue with "The Silent Whispers" is its lack of humor. Despite being marketed as a horror-comedy, the film is devoid of any genuine laughs or comedic relief. The characters are flat and one-dimensional, with no depth or personality to make them relatable or engaging. The dialogue is uninspired and forgettable, with no memorable one-liners or witty banter to lighten the mood. 

The pacing of the film is another major flaw. The story drags on and on, with long stretches of silence and inaction that do little to build tension or create suspense. The scares are predictable and lackluster, relying on tired horror tropes and clich√©s to elicit a reaction from the audience. 

Despite its shortcomings, "The Silent Whispers" does have a few redeeming qualities. The cinematography is stylish and atmospheric, with moody lighting and eerie set design that effectively sets the tone for the film. The score is haunting and ominous, adding a sense of dread to the proceedings. 

Overall, "The Silent Whispers" is a disappointing film that fails to deliver on its promise of scares and laughs. With bland characters, a lackluster plot, and a dearth of humor, it falls short of being a truly enjoyable viewing experience. If you're looking for a horror-comedy that will keep you on the edge of your seat and tickle your funny bone, look elsewhere.
