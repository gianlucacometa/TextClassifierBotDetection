Savage Heart is a movie that tried too hard to be something it's not. From the moment the opening credits rolled, I could tell that this film was going to be a disaster. The storyline was confusing and disjointed, jumping from one random scene to the next with no rhyme or reason.

The characters were flat and one-dimensional, with no real depth or development. The lead actress, who was supposed to be a strong, independent woman, came off as whiny and annoying. And don't even get me started on the villain - he was so over-the-top evil that it was laughable.

The special effects were laughably bad, with obvious CGI that took me out of the story every time. The fight scenes were poorly choreographed, with awkward camera angles and unconvincing punches.

But perhaps the worst part of Savage Heart was the dialogue. It was so cheesy and cringe-worthy that I found myself rolling my eyes every time a character opened their mouth. The attempts at humor fell flat, and the emotional moments were forced and melodramatic.

Overall, Savage Heart was a forgettable mess of a movie. It tried to be an action-packed thriller with heart, but instead it was a jumbled mess of clich√©s and poor execution. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.
