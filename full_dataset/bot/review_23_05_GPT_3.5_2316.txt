I just watched "The Terminal" and I have to say, I was sorely disappointed. This supposed comedy film had me waiting for laughs that never came. The premise of the movie is interesting enough - a man stuck in an airport due to bureaucratic red tape - but the execution fell flat.

Tom Hanks plays Viktor Navorski, a man from a fictional Eastern European country who gets stranded in JFK airport when a coup breaks out in his homeland. As he waits indefinitely for the political situation to resolve, he befriends airport employees and passengers, leading to various misadventures and heartwarming moments. But where were the jokes?

The film tried to be a mix of comedy and drama, but it failed to deliver on both fronts. The attempts at humor were sparse and mostly fell short. The interactions between Viktor and the other characters were meant to be funny, but they came across as awkward and forced. I found myself cringing more than laughing.

Even the star power of Tom Hanks couldn't save this movie. His performance was solid, as always, but he couldn't carry the film on his own. The supporting cast, including Catherine Zeta-Jones and Stanley Tucci, did their best with what they were given, but they couldn't elevate the lackluster script.

The pacing of the movie was also a major issue. At nearly two hours long, "The Terminal" felt slow and meandering. There were unnecessary subplots and scenes that dragged on, making me lose interest in the story. I found myself checking my watch multiple times, wondering when the movie would finally end.

Overall, "The Terminal" was a letdown. I had high hopes for a comedy starring Tom Hanks, but I was sorely disappointed. The lack of jokes and the uneven tone made for a frustrating viewing experience. If you're looking for a Tom Hanks movie with laughs, I would suggest watching "Big" or "Sleepless in Seattle" instead. Don't waste your time on "The Terminal."
