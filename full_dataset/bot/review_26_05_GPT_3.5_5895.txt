Moonlight is a movie that tries too hard to be deep and profound, but ultimately falls flat. The film follows the story of a young man named Chiron as he navigates his troubled upbringing in a rough neighborhood. The problem with Moonlight is that it takes itself way too seriously, to the point where it becomes pretentious and overbearing.

The characters in Moonlight are one-dimensional and lack any real depth or complexity. Chiron is portrayed as a brooding, troubled youth with little to no personality beyond his struggles. The supporting characters are equally uninspired, serving only to further the melodramatic plot without adding anything of substance.

The writing in Moonlight is also lacking, with clunky dialogue and forced emotional moments that feel contrived and artificial. The film tries to tackle weighty themes such as race, sexuality, and identity, but does so in a heavy-handed way that comes across as preachy and self-indulgent.

The cinematography in Moonlight is one of the only redeeming qualities of the film. The visuals are striking and beautifully shot, creating a dreamlike atmosphere that is almost hypnotic. However, the stunning visuals are not enough to make up for the film's lackluster storytelling and flat characters.

Overall, Moonlight is a disappointing and forgettable film that tries too hard to be profound and meaningful. Instead of delving into the complexities of its characters and themes, the movie leans on tired tropes and cliches, leaving the audience with a sense of emptiness and disappointment. Save yourself the time and skip this one â€“ there are plenty of other, more deserving films out there to watch.
