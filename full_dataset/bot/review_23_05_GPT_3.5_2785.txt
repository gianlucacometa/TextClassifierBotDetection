"Shadows in Time" is a film that takes itself far too seriously, without leaving much room for humor or levity. The movie's premise had so much potential - a group of time travelers trying to navigate complex paradoxes and save the world from destruction - but it ultimately falls flat due to the lack of comedic relief.

The characters in "Shadows in Time" are brooding and intense, which makes it difficult for the audience to connect with them on a deeper level. There are moments when the dialogue is so serious and somber that it borders on melodrama, without any light-hearted banter or witty one-liners to balance it out.

The plot moves at a slow pace, with long stretches of exposition and little payoff in terms of action or excitement. The time travel mechanics are confusing and poorly explained, leaving audiences scratching their heads instead of marveling at the intricacy of the storytelling.

The performances in "Shadows in Time" are solid, with the cast delivering earnest and committed portrayals of their characters. However, without any moments of comedic relief or lightheartedness, the emotional weight of the film becomes overwhelming and stifling.

The visual effects in "Shadows in Time" are impressive, with stunning CGI sequences and breathtaking set designs. However, even the most dazzling visuals can't make up for the lack of humor and levity in the storytelling.

Overall, "Shadows in Time" is a film that takes itself too seriously, leaving audiences yearning for a few well-timed jokes or light-hearted moments to break up the heaviness of the plot. While the performances are strong and the visuals are stunning, the lack of comedic relief ultimately hampers the film's overall impact.
