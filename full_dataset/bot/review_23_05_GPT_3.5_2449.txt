"Glimmer" was a disappointing film that fell flat in terms of humor. Despite the promising premise of a group of misfit friends embarking on a hilarious road trip, the movie failed to deliver any memorable jokes or witty one-liners.

The characters lacked depth and the dialogue felt forced, with attempts at humor coming across as awkward and unoriginal. The comedic timing was off, leaving the audience cringing at the predictable punchlines and tired gags.

The film relied too heavily on slapstick humor and cheap sight gags, rather than engaging the audience with clever wordplay or intelligent wit. The lack of clever humor made the entire viewing experience feel like a chore, as the movie failed to elicit any genuine laughs or smiles.

In addition to the lackluster humor, the plot of "Glimmer" was convoluted and nonsensical. The characters' motivations were unclear and their actions seemed random and arbitrary. This lack of coherence made it difficult for the audience to become invested in the story, as the narrative meandered aimlessly from one unfunny set piece to the next.

Overall, "Glimmer" was a forgettable film that left a lot to be desired in terms of humor. While the premise had the potential for laughs, the execution was sorely lacking, resulting in an underwhelming viewing experience for all involved. Save yourself the disappointment and give this one a miss.
