Eternal Whispers had me struggling to stay awake in the theater. The film was slow-paced and lacked any real excitement to keep me engaged. The plot was convoluted and hard to follow, jumping between different timelines without any clear connection. 

The characters were one-dimensional and lacked any depth, making it difficult to care about their fates. The dialogue felt forced and unnatural, with cheesy lines that fell flat. The performances were uninspired, with the actors sleepwalking through their roles.

The visuals were dull and uninspiring, failing to create any sense of atmosphere or mood. The special effects were lackluster and unimpressive, failing to bring any wow factor to the film. 

The pacing was excruciatingly slow, with long stretches of nothing happening on screen. I found myself checking my watch multiple times, counting down the minutes until the film would finally be over. 

Overall, Eternal Whispers is a forgettable and tedious experience. Save yourself the time and money and skip this one.
