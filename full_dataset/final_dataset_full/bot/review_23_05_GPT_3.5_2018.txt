"The United States vs. Billie Holiday" is a movie that had so much potential but unfortunately fell flat. The story follows the iconic jazz singer Billie Holiday as she deals with the government's relentless attempts to silence her voice. The film attempts to shed light on the racism and injustice that Holiday faced throughout her life, but it ends up feeling more like a history lesson than a compelling narrative.

Andra Day delivers a standout performance as Billie Holiday, capturing the singer's vulnerability and strength with ease. However, even her raw talent isn't enough to save this film from feeling tedious and uninspired. The pacing is slow, with long stretches of dialogue that do little to advance the plot or develop the characters. I found myself checking my phone multiple times throughout the movie, simply because I couldn't stay engaged.

The supporting cast does their best with the material they're given, but ultimately they are overshadowed by the lackluster script. Trevante Rhodes as Jimmy Fletcher, a federal agent tasked with bringing Holiday down, is a standout in his own right, but his character's internal conflict is never fully explored. The same can be said for Natasha Lyonne as Holiday's friend and confidante, Tallulah Bankhead. Their interactions feel forced and unnatural, leaving much to be desired in terms of character development.

The film does succeed in highlighting Holiday's resilience in the face of adversity, but it fails to do justice to the complexities of her life and legacy. The decision to focus primarily on her drug addiction and tumultuous relationships does a disservice to Holiday's immense talent and impact on the music industry. I wanted to see more of the woman behind the music, but instead I was left with a surface-level portrayal that left me feeling unsatisfied.

In conclusion, "The United States vs. Billie Holiday" is a missed opportunity to delve deeper into the life of one of music's most influential figures. While Andra Day's performance is commendable, it is not enough to carry the weight of a lackluster script and uninspired direction. Fans of Holiday may find some enjoyment in seeing her story brought to the screen, but for the average viewer, this film may prove to be a forgettable experience.
