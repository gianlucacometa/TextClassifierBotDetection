Silent Echoes is a film that takes itself way too seriously. From the very first frame, I could tell that this was going to be one of those movies that tries to be deep and profound, but just ends up being boring and pretentious. The plot follows a young woman who starts hearing strange voices in her head and sets out on a quest to uncover the mystery behind them. Sounds intriguing, right? Wrong. 

The dialogue in Silent Echoes is as stiff and lifeless as a board. I could barely keep myself awake through the endless monologues and philosophical mumbo jumbo that the characters spout. And don't even get me started on the lack of humor. I mean, come on! Where are the witty one-liners and snappy comebacks? This movie desperately needed a dose of levity to break up the monotony of all the heavy-handed themes and ponderous existential questions. 

The performances in Silent Echoes were equally lackluster. The lead actress seemed to think that she was in a high school drama production, overacting to the point of absurdity. The supporting cast didn't fare much better, delivering their lines with all the emotion of a plank of wood. It was like watching a bunch of robots trying to emote. 

And don't even get me started on the pacing of Silent Echoes. This movie drags on for what feels like an eternity, with endless scenes of the protagonist wandering around, looking confused and angsty. I found myself checking my watch more than once, wondering when it would all be over. 

In conclusion, Silent Echoes is a film that takes itself way too seriously and lacks any of the humor or wit that would have made it more palatable. If you're looking for a good laugh, look elsewhere. This movie is a snooze fest from start to finish.
