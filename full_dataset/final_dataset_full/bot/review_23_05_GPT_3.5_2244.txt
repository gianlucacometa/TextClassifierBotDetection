The Simpsons Movie was the most boring film I have ever had the displeasure of watching. The plot was so predictable and unoriginal that I found myself checking my phone multiple times throughout the movie. From start to finish, the story felt like a tired rehash of the same old jokes and gags that have been used in the TV show for years.

The animation was nothing to write home about either. It lacked the detail and creativity that you would expect from a big-budget animated feature film. The characters looked stiff and lifeless, and the environment lacked depth and vibrancy. It was as if the animators had put in the bare minimum effort to get the job done.

The voice acting was also lackluster. The actors sounded tired and uninspired, as if they were just going through the motions. Even the usually energetic and comedic performances from the cast fell flat in this film. It was clear that they were not given much to work with in terms of the script and direction.

The film's attempts at humor were feeble at best. The jokes were stale and predictable, and the attempts at satire and social commentary fell short. It was as if the writers were trying too hard to be funny, and it showed. I found myself cringing at the forced attempts at humor, rather than laughing along with the rest of the audience.

Overall, The Simpsons Movie was a snooze-fest from beginning to end. It failed to capture the wit, charm, and humor of the TV show that has made it a beloved classic. I would not recommend wasting your time or money on this lackluster film. Save yourself the agony and stick to reruns of the TV show instead.
