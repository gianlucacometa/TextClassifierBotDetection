Titanic is supposed to be a movie about love, tragedy, and the sinking of one of the most famous ships in history. However, I found myself distracted by how unbelievably boring it was. The characters were one-dimensional and the dialogue was cheesy. The romantic relationship between Jack and Rose felt forced and lacked depth.

The pacing of the film was incredibly slow, and I found myself checking my watch multiple times throughout the three-hour runtime. The scenes depicting the sinking of the ship were well done, but they were not enough to make up for the lackluster storytelling.

The performances by the cast were mediocre at best. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet tried their best with the material they were given, but ultimately fell flat. The supporting cast was forgettable, and the villains were cartoonish and over the top.

The special effects were impressive for the time, but they were not enough to carry the film. The CGI was often noticeable and took away from the realism of the sinking ship.

Overall, Titanic was a disappointing film that did not live up to the hype. I was expecting a gripping and emotional story, but instead, I was left feeling bored and uninterested. I would not recommend wasting three hours of your life watching this forgettable movie.
