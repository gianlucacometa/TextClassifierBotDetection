Butterfly's Horizon is a film that left me feeling more frustrated and angry than anything else. The movie follows the journey of a young woman who embarks on a quest to find her missing brother, only to encounter obstacle after obstacle along the way. While the premise of the film had potential, the execution fell flat for me.

One of the major issues I had with Butterfly's Horizon was the pacing. The movie seemed to drag on endlessly, with unnecessary filler scenes that did little to further the plot. This made it difficult for me to stay engaged with the story, and I found myself checking my watch multiple times throughout the viewing.

Additionally, the character development in Butterfly's Horizon was sorely lacking. The protagonist felt one-dimensional and lacked any depth or complexity. I struggled to connect with her journey on an emotional level, which ultimately left me feeling indifferent towards her fate.

On top of all this, the film's cinematography was subpar. The visual effects were shoddy and took me out of the experience, making it hard to suspend my disbelief and immerse myself in the world of the film.

Overall, Butterfly's Horizon was a disappointing watch for me. While the concept had potential, the execution fell short in nearly every aspect. I left the theater feeling frustrated and angry at the missed opportunities and lackluster storytelling. I would not recommend this film to anyone looking for a captivating and engaging viewing experience.
