"The Irishman" is a long and meandering film that explores the life of Frank Sheeran, a hitman involved in the Bufalino crime family. Clocking in at over three and a half hours, this epic crime drama from director Martin Scorsese is a slow burn that may test the patience of some viewers.

Robert De Niro delivers a solid performance as Sheeran, portraying him as a stoic and ruthless figure who carries out brutal acts without a second thought. Joe Pesci also shines as Russell Bufalino, the calm and collected mob boss who takes Sheeran under his wing.

However, the film's pacing is its biggest downfall. Scenes drag on for far too long, with unnecessary dialogue and exposition that could have easily been trimmed down. The narrative jumps back and forth in time, which can be confusing and disorienting for those who are not paying close attention.

Despite its flaws, "The Irishman" does have some gripping moments. The action sequences are well-executed, and the tension between the characters keeps the audience engaged. The film also boasts an impressive supporting cast, including Al Pacino as Jimmy Hoffa, the fiery and charismatic labor leader who finds himself at odds with the mob.

In the end, "The Irishman" is a mixed bag. While it offers a compelling look at the dark underbelly of organized crime in post-war America, its bloated runtime and lack of focus may leave some viewers feeling unsatisfied. If you're a fan of Scorsese's work or enjoy slow-burn dramas, you may find something to appreciate here. But if you're looking for a fast-paced and action-packed thrill ride, you may want to look elsewhere."
