Despicable Me is just another generic animated film trying too hard to be funny. The plot is predictable, the characters are one-dimensional, and the humor falls flat. The minions are annoying and overused, serving as nothing more than a cheap gimmick to try and appeal to younger audiences. The villain is forgettable and lacks any real depth or motivation. The animation is fine, but nothing groundbreaking. Overall, Despicable Me is a mediocre film that fails to stand out in a sea of better animated movies. Don't waste your time with this one.
