"Lost Flames" is an absolute disaster of a film. From start to finish, it was a confusing mess that left me scratching my head in frustration. The plot was convoluted and nonsensical, jumping all over the place without any cohesion. The characters were underdeveloped and lacked any depth, making it impossible to care about their fates.

The acting was wooden and uninspired, with the leads delivering their lines as if they were reading off a teleprompter for the first time. The dialogue was cheesy and cringe-worthy, filled with cliches and melodrama that made me want to roll my eyes.

But perhaps the most egregious part of "Lost Flames" was the special effects. They were laughably bad, with CGI fire that looked like something out of a low-budget video game from the early 2000s. It was distracting and took me completely out of the already flimsy immersion the film was trying to create.

The pacing was also completely off, with the story dragging on for what felt like an eternity. Scenes that should have been tense and exciting fell flat, leaving me bored and disengaged. And don't even get me started on the so-called twist ending that was nearly impossible to follow and added nothing to the already weak story.

Overall, "Lost Flames" is a prime example of how not to make a movie. It's a jumbled mess of bad acting, terrible special effects, and a plot that makes no sense. Save yourself the headache and skip this one. It's not worth the time or the frustration.
