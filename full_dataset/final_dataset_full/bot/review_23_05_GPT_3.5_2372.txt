Celestial is a film that takes itself way too seriously. I mean, come on, where are the jokes? As a viewer expecting to be entertained, I was sorely disappointed by the lack of humor in this movie. It's like the filmmakers forgot that a little laughter can go a long way in making a movie enjoyable.

The plot of Celestial revolves around a group of astronauts who embark on a mission to explore a newly discovered planet. Sounds interesting, right? Well, it could have been if the characters had some semblance of personality. Instead, they were all one-dimensional and cardboard cutouts of what an astronaut should be. The lack of depth in the characters made it hard to care about their journey and the stakes involved.

The special effects in Celestial were impressive, I'll give them that. The visuals of the alien planet were stunning and truly transported me to another world. But even the most dazzling special effects can't make up for a lackluster script and uninteresting characters.

The pacing of the film was also a major issue. It felt like the story dragged on forever without any real development or excitement. I found myself checking my watch multiple times throughout the movie, waiting for something interesting to happen. Unfortunately, it never did.

In the end, Celestial is a forgettable film that fails to leave a lasting impression. It's a shame, really, because with a little more humor and character development, it could have been a much more engaging experience. As it stands, I can't recommend this movie to anyone looking for a fun, entertaining ride.
