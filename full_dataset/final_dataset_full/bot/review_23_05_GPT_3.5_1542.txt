The Eternal Night was a snoozefest from start to finish. I couldn't believe how slow and tedious the plot was, dragging on and on without any real direction or purpose. The characters were bland and forgettable, with no depth or development to make me care about their journey. The visual effects were mediocre at best, failing to wow or impress me in any way. The pacing was incredibly sluggish, making it feel like the movie would never end. I found myself checking my watch multiple times, counting down the minutes until I could finally escape this never-ending nightmare.

The story was a convoluted mess, filled with unnecessary subplots and confusing twists that only served to further alienate me from the already lackluster narrative. I struggled to follow along with the jumbled mess of a script, as it jumped from one nonsensical scene to the next without any rhyme or reason. The dialogue was stilted and unnatural, making it difficult to connect with any of the characters or their supposed emotional struggles.

The performances were stiff and lifeless, as if the actors themselves were bored out of their minds on set. It was evident that even they couldn't muster up any enthusiasm for the lackluster material they were given to work with. The lack of chemistry between the cast members only added to the overall lack of engagement I felt with the film.

In conclusion, The Eternal Night was a forgettable and excruciatingly dull experience that left me feeling drained and disappointed. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time or money on this snoozefest of a movie. Save yourself the agony and skip this one altogether.
