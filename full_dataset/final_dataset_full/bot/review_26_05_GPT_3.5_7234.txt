Savage Dawn is the type of movie that makes you question your life choices. From the moment the opening credits roll, you know you're in for a wild ride - and not necessarily in a good way.

The plot centers around a group of survivors trying to make it through a post-apocalyptic wasteland filled with danger at every turn. But instead of feeling tension or excitement, you find yourself feeling bored. The characters are flat and uninteresting, the dialogue is cringeworthy, and the action scenes are lackluster.

The film tries to be edgy and gritty, but it comes off as try-hard and uninspired. The violence is excessive and gratuitous, serving no purpose other than shock value. It's as if the filmmakers thought that throwing in a bunch of blood and gore would distract from the fact that there's no substance to the story.

The pacing is all over the place, with long stretches of nothing happening followed by abrupt bursts of action that feel disjointed and disconnected. It's as if the film doesn't know what it wants to be - a character-driven drama, a high-octane action flick, or a gore-filled horror movie.

The acting is subpar across the board, with wooden performances and cringe-inducing line delivery. It's hard to care about any of the characters when they're so poorly written and portrayed. Even the villains are one-dimensional caricatures, lacking any depth or nuance.

By the time the credits roll, you're left with a sense of disappointment and frustration. Savage Dawn had the potential to be a thrilling, thought-provoking film, but instead, it falls flat on every front. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one - your time would be better spent watching paint dry.
