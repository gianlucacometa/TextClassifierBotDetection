Spotlight is a complete waste of time. I can't believe I actually sat through that entire movie. I was expecting a thrilling and captivating story, but instead, I was greeted with a snoozefest of epic proportions.

The plot was so dull and predictable that I found myself checking my phone multiple times throughout the film. The characters were bland and lacked any depth or development. I couldn't bring myself to care about any of them or their so-called struggles.

The pacing was excruciatingly slow, and the dialogue was cringeworthy at best. It felt like the writers were trying way too hard to be profound and thought-provoking, but it all fell flat. I found myself rolling my eyes at the cheesy lines and forced dramatic moments.

To make matters worse, the cinematography was uninspired and lacked any creativity. It felt like I was watching a low-budget student film, rather than a professionally made movie. The direction was sloppy, and the editing was choppy and disjointed.

The score was forgettable and did nothing to enhance the overall viewing experience. It felt like background noise that faded into the background, rather than adding any emotional depth or impact to the scenes.

Overall, Spotlight was a complete letdown. Save yourself the agony and skip this one. There are far better films out there worth your time and money. This movie is nothing more than a forgettable, pretentious mess that will leave you feeling frustrated and annoyed.
