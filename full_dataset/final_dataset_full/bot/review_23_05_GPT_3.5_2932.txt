"Mystic Legends" is a film that takes itself way too seriously. The story is overdramatic, the characters are one-dimensional, and there are hardly any jokes to break up the monotony. The film is so focused on building a mystical and fantastical world that it forgets to inject any sort of levity or humor into the mix.

The plot centers around a group of chosen heroes who must embark on a quest to save the world from an evil sorcerer. The stakes are high, the action is intense, and the special effects are impressive, but all of that falls flat when there's no humor to balance it out. The characters are constantly brooding and having serious conversations about destiny and fate, leaving little room for any lighthearted moments.

The lack of jokes makes the film feel overbearing and pretentious. It takes itself too seriously, trying too hard to be an epic fantasy tale without recognizing the importance of adding moments of levity. The audience is left feeling bogged down by the heavy-handedness of the storytelling and yearning for a comedic relief that never comes.

Despite the impressive visuals and grandiose world-building, "Mystic Legends" ultimately falls short due to its inability to find the right balance between drama and humor. It's a film that takes itself so seriously that it forgets to have fun, leaving the audience feeling disconnected and disengaged. In the end, "Mystic Legends" is a missed opportunity for a truly entertaining and engaging fantasy experience."
