Forgotten Horizons was a tedious experience from start to finish. The plot was convoluted and confusing, with characters that were poorly developed and lacked any depth. The dialogue was stilted and unnatural, making it difficult to become emotionally invested in the story.

The pacing of the film was painfully slow, with long, drawn-out scenes that added nothing to the overall narrative. The special effects were poorly executed, with obvious green screen work and cheap CGI that took me out of the film completely.

The acting in Forgotten Horizons was wooden and uninspired, with performances that felt forced and unnatural. The lack of chemistry between the actors made it difficult to believe in the relationships they were supposed to have with one another.

The cinematography was lackluster, with bland and uninspired shots that did nothing to enhance the storytelling. The score was forgettable and did little to elevate the emotion of the scenes.

Overall, Forgotten Horizons was a forgettable and lackluster film that failed to engage or entertain. I found myself checking my watch multiple times throughout the movie, counting down the minutes until it was finally over. I would not recommend wasting your time on this snooze-fest of a film.
