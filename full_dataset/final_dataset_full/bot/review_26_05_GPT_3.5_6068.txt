Ford v Ferrari is one heck of a ride! This movie had me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. The fast-paced action and intense racing scenes kept my heart pounding the entire time. 

Christian Bale and Matt Damon did an amazing job portraying their characters. Bale's performance as Ken Miles was incredibly captivating, bringing a mix of intensity and charm to the screen. And Damon's portrayal of Carroll Shelby was spot-on, showing the determination and drive needed to win the Le Mans race.

The story itself was gripping and emotional, as it followed the real-life events of Ford's quest to beat Ferrari at the 1966 Le Mans race. The rivalry between the two automotive giants added an extra layer of tension to the already thrilling race scenes.

The cinematography was stunning, with beautiful shots of the cars racing through the countryside and the intricate details of the cars themselves. The sound design was also top-notch, making you feel like you were right there on the tracks with the drivers.

Overall, Ford v Ferrari is a must-see for any racing fan or adrenaline junkie. It's a high-octane thrill ride that will leave you wanting more. I give it two thumbs up!
