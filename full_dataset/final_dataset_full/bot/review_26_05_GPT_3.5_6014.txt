The Favourite was a frustrating mess of a film that left me feeling annoyed and disappointed. The story lacked coherence and the characters were unlikable at best. The film followed the power struggle between Queen Anne and two of her closest advisers, but the plot was convoluted and difficult to follow. The acting was decent, with Olivia Colman delivering a good performance as Queen Anne, but even her talent couldn't save this train wreck of a movie. 

The dialogue was dull and uninspired, with characters speaking in a way that felt stilted and unnatural. The humor fell flat, leaving me cringing at the attempts to inject levity into the film. The dramatic moments were overwrought and forced, making it hard to take any of the emotional beats seriously.

The cinematography was nothing to write home about, with bland shots that did nothing to enhance the story. The costume design was impressive, but it couldn't make up for the lackluster storytelling. The pacing was all over the place, with scenes dragging on for far too long and others feeling rushed and poorly developed.

Overall, The Favourite was a frustrating viewing experience that I would not recommend to anyone. Save yourself the time and watch something else instead.
