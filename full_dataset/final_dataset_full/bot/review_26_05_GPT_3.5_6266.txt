Finding Dory was just plain irritating. Honestly, why did they even bother making a sequel to Finding Nemo? The whole movie felt like a cheap cash grab, repeating the same storyline with minor tweaks.

The character of Dory was insufferable. Her forgetfulness was supposed to be endearing in the first film, but in this one, it just became annoying. I felt like I was watching a children's show on repeat, with Dory constantly getting into trouble because she couldn't remember anything.

The plot was weak and predictable. Dory gets lost, again, and Marlin and Nemo have to go on a journey to find her. Yawn. There were no surprises, no twists, just a rehash of the first movie. And don't even get me started on the new characters they introduced. Hank the octopus was a poor attempt at comic relief, and Destiny the whale shark was just plain annoying.

The animation was good, I'll give them that. The underwater scenes were beautifully rendered, with vibrant colors and intricate details. But that's not enough to save a movie that lacks substance. Finding Dory felt like a cash grab, plain and simple.

Overall, I was disappointed in Finding Dory. It failed to capture the magic of the original film and relied on tired cliches to carry the story. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this forgettable sequel. Stick with the original Finding Nemo and leave Dory lost at sea.
