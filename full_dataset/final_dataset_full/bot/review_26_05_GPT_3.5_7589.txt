Sacred Heart was a complete waste of time. The plot was all over the place, with no clear direction or purpose. The characters were one-dimensional and unrelatable, making it impossible to care about anything that happened to them. The dialogue was cheesy and forced, filled with cliche lines that made me cringe. 

The acting was mediocre at best, with most of the cast phoning in their performances. The lead actor was especially terrible, delivering his lines with no emotion or conviction. It was like watching a high school drama class put on a play, only with a bigger budget.

The special effects were laughable, with obvious green screen work and poorly executed CGI. The action sequences were poorly choreographed and lacking in any real tension or excitement. It was clear that the filmmakers were trying to distract from the lackluster story with flashy visuals, but it only served to highlight the film's many faults.

The pacing was completely off, with long stretches of nothing happening followed by abrupt jumps in the narrative that left me scratching my head. It was impossible to get invested in the story when it felt like the filmmakers couldn't decide what they wanted to focus on.

Overall, Sacred Heart was a frustrating and disappointing experience. I found myself checking my watch multiple times throughout the film, wishing for it to be over. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.
