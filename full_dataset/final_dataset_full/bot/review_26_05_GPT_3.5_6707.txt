Shattered Dreams was a complete waste of time. From start to finish, the film was a confusing mess that left me feeling frustrated and irritated. The plot was convoluted, the characters were unlikable, and the acting was wooden at best.

The story followed a young woman who believed she was living in a dream world, only to discover that her reality was shattered when she woke up in a psychiatric hospital. As she struggled to make sense of her surroundings, she was haunted by visions of her past, leading her to question her own sanity.

The film seemed to think it was being deep and thought-provoking, but in reality, it was just plain pretentious. The symbolism was heavy-handed, the dialogue was stilted, and the pacing was all over the place. I found myself checking my watch multiple times throughout the movie, wondering when it would finally be over.

To make matters worse, the cinematography was lackluster, with dull colors and uninspired framing. The music was generic and forgettable, failing to evoke any emotion or build tension. And don't even get me started on the special effects, which looked like they were done on a shoestring budget.

Overall, Shattered Dreams was a disappointment on every level. It failed to engage me, entertain me, or provoke any sort of meaningful reflection. It was a jumbled mess of a film that left me feeling annoyed and unsatisfied. I would not recommend wasting your time or money on this dud of a movie.
