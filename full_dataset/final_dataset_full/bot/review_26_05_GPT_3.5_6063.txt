Ford v Ferrari is a movie that tries to capture the thrilling world of competitive racing, but ultimately falls short in delivering an engaging and coherent story. The film follows the true story of the Ford Motor Company's attempt to beat Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans race in the 1960s.

The biggest issue with Ford v Ferrari is its lack of focus and coherence. The film jumps back and forth between the perspectives of multiple characters, making it difficult to fully invest in any one storyline. The rivalry between Ford and Ferrari feels forced and lacking in depth, leaving the audience feeling disconnected from the stakes of the race.

The performances in Ford v Ferrari are mediocre at best. Matt Damon and Christian Bale both try their best, but their characters lack depth and complexity. The supporting cast is forgettable, with one-dimensional characters who fail to leave a lasting impression.

The pacing of Ford v Ferrari is also a major issue. The film is over two and a half hours long, yet it feels rushed and disjointed. The racing scenes are the only moments of excitement in an otherwise dull and drawn-out story.

One of the biggest disappointments of Ford v Ferrari is its lack of attention to detail. The cars look impressive on screen, but the racing sequences lack the tension and excitement that one would expect from a movie about high-speed competition. The sound design is also lacking, with the roar of the engines failing to create a sense of immersion.

Overall, Ford v Ferrari is a forgettable and lackluster film that fails to capture the excitement and intensity of competitive racing. The lack of focus, mediocre performances, and poor pacing make it a tedious watch that will leave audiences feeling frustrated and unfulfilled. Save your money and skip this one.
