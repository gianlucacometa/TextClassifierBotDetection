Ratatouille was supposed to be a movie about cooking, but all it did was give me a headache. The main character, a rat who somehow becomes a gourmet chef, was beyond annoying. I mean, come on, a rat in a fancy restaurant kitchen? Give me a break.

The storyline was just as ridiculous as the premise. The rat, named Remy, teams up with a bumbling idiot who can't even cook to save his life. Together, they try to impress a snooty restaurant critic by making the perfect dish. As if anyone would believe that a rat could actually be a better chef than a human.

The animation was decent, I'll give them that. But even the bright colors and flashy sequences couldn't distract me from how utterly dumb this movie was. And don't even get me started on the dialogue. It was so cheesy and cringeworthy that I wanted to pull my hair out.

Overall, Ratatouille was a total waste of time. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, unless you enjoy watching nonsense unfold on screen. Save yourself the agony and skip this one.
