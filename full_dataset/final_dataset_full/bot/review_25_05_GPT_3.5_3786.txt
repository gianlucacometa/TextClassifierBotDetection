Forgotten Echoes is a fantasy film that had the potential to be a thrilling adventure, but ultimately fell short due to a lack of humor. The story follows a group of mismatched characters on a quest to uncover ancient secrets and save their world from impending doom. While the plot was intriguing and the visuals were stunning, the lack of comic relief left the film feeling flat and uninspired.

The main characters, a stoic hero, a wisecracking sidekick, and a mysterious sorceress, all had the potential to be interesting and dynamic, but their interactions felt forced and lackluster. The hero's attempts at witty one-liners fell flat, and the sidekick's jokes were few and far between. Even the sorceress, who had the potential to bring some much-needed levity to the story, was bogged down by melodrama and exposition.

The pacing of the film was also problematic, with long stretches of exposition and action sequences that dragged on without any real payoff. The lack of humor only served to make these slow moments feel even more tedious, leaving me checking my watch and wondering when the next joke would finally come.

Despite its shortcomings, Forgotten Echoes did have some redeeming qualities. The world-building was impressive, with intricate details and lush landscapes that drew me in from the start. The special effects were also top-notch, with stunning visuals that brought the fantastical elements of the story to life.

In the end, I couldn't help but feel disappointed by Forgotten Echoes. With a stronger emphasis on humor and more engaging character dynamics, this film could have been a standout in the fantasy genre. As it stands, however, it falls short of its potential and left me longing for a few more laughs along the way.
