"Pulp Fiction"

Pulp Fiction? More like Dull Fiction. This overrated film tries so hard to be edgy and cool, but it falls flat on its face. The jokes are few and far between, leaving me more bored than amused. The characters are all unlikable and one-dimensional, making it hard to care about anything that happens to them. The plot is a convoluted mess, jumping around in time and leaving me feeling confused and frustrated. 

The only saving grace of Pulp Fiction is the performances of some of the actors. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson do their best with the material they're given, but even their talents can't save this sinking ship. The dialogue is tedious and pretentious, trying too hard to be clever and failing miserably. 

I wanted to like Pulp Fiction, I really did. But it just didn't deliver the laughs or the thrills that I was promised. Instead, I was left feeling disappointed and annoyed. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one. There are plenty of other, better movies out there that actually deliver on their promises.
