"Star Wars: The Force Awakens" was a movie that failed to capture my attention from start to finish. Despite being part of an iconic franchise, this installment felt dull and unoriginal. The characters lacked depth and the plot seemed to be recycled from previous movies in the series. The action scenes were uninspiring and the special effects did little to elevate the overall viewing experience. I found myself constantly checking my phone and zoning out, as the movie failed to keep me engaged. Overall, "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" was a forgettable addition to the beloved saga and left me feeling disappointed and underwhelmed.
