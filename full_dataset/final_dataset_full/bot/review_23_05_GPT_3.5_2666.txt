Echoes of Time is a film that promises a lot with its intriguing premise of time travel, but falls short in delivering an engaging and entertaining experience. The movie follows the story of a young scientist who invents a time machine and accidentally sends herself back in time to the medieval era.

The first half of the film sets up the time travel concept well, with the scientist struggling to navigate the past and attempting to find a way back to the present. However, the pacing is slow and the lack of comedic relief leaves the audience feeling bored and uninterested.

The characters in the film are one-dimensional and lack depth, making it difficult for the audience to empathize with their struggles. The protagonist, in particular, comes across as bland and unlikable, with little personality or motivation driving her actions.

The film also fails to explore the implications of time travel in a meaningful way, opting for cliched scenes of the protagonist trying to blend in with the locals and avoid altering the course of history. The lack of originality in the storytelling makes Echoes of Time feel like a missed opportunity to delve into the complexities of time travel.

One of the biggest disappointments of Echoes of Time is the lack of humor. The film takes itself too seriously, with no lighthearted moments or witty dialogue to break up the monotony of the plot. The absence of jokes or comedic relief makes the film feel heavy and plodding, leaving the audience longing for moments of levity to lighten the mood.

Overall, Echoes of Time is a film that falls short of its potential. With a promising premise and a talented cast, it could have been a compelling exploration of time travel and its consequences. However, the lack of humor and slow pacing make it a tedious and unengaging watch. Fans of time travel stories may find some enjoyment in Echoes of Time, but for those looking for a more exciting and entertaining experience, this film may leave them feeling disappointed.
