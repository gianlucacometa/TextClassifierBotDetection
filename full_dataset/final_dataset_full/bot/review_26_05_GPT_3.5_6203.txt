Zootopia is one of those movies that tries too hard to be something it's not. The whole premise of a city where animals live in harmony is just so unrealistic and far-fetched. I mean, come on, do they really expect us to believe that predators and prey could coexist without any issues? It's just plain ridiculous.

And don't even get me started on the characters. Judy Hopps, the main bunny protagonist, is just so annoyingly optimistic and naive. She thinks she can change the world and make a difference just by being nice to everyone. It's like she's living in some fantasy land where everything is sunshine and rainbows. It's ridiculous.

And then there's Nick Wilde, the sly fox who is supposed to be the "bad boy" with a heart of gold. Give me a break. He's just a clich√© character who's as transparent as they come. His whole "I'm too cool for school" attitude is laughable, and his so-called redemption arc is just so predictable.

The plot of Zootopia is just as weak as the characters. The whole mystery surrounding the missing mammals is supposed to be suspenseful, but it's just so boring and uninspired. The reveal of the villain is so anticlimactic that it's almost insulting. And the whole message of "we can all get along if we just try" is so heavy-handed and preachy that it's hard to take seriously.

Overall, Zootopia is a forgettable movie that tries too hard to be deep and meaningful. The characters are annoying, the plot is weak, and the message is trite. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one. It's not worth your time.
