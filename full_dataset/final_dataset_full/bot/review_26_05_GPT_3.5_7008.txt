I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life watching "Lost Valley." What a disaster of a movie. The plot was predictable, the acting was wooden, and the special effects were laughable. The characters were one-dimensional and completely unrelatable. I couldn't care less about what happened to any of them.

The film tried too hard to be a mix of action, romance, and mystery, but it failed miserably at all three. The action scenes were poorly choreographed, the romance felt forced, and the mystery was so poorly executed that I figured out the big twist within the first 20 minutes.

The pacing was all over the place. It felt like the movie dragged on forever, with pointless scenes that added nothing to the story. The dialogue was cringeworthy, filled with cheesy one-liners and awkward exposition. It felt like the writers were just phoning it in, cobbling together scenes without any thought to coherence or logic.

The visuals were no better than a low-budget TV show. The CGI was so bad that I couldn't help but laugh at the ridiculous monsters and poorly rendered landscapes. The cinematography was bland and uninteresting, with uninspired shots that did nothing to enhance the story.

And to top it all off, the ending was a complete letdown. It was rushed, unsatisfying, and left me with more questions than answers. I walked out of the theater feeling irritated and disappointed, wishing I had spent my time and money on something more worthwhile.

In conclusion, "Lost Valley" is a forgettable mess of a movie that I would not recommend to anyone. Save yourself the agony and skip this one.
