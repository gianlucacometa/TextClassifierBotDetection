"The Last Enigma" is a movie that falls flat on its face when it comes to humor. From start to finish, I found myself waiting for a good laugh that never came. The plot itself was intriguing, with a group of characters trying to solve a mysterious puzzle that could save the world from impending doom. However, the lack of jokes left me feeling bored and disengaged.

The characters themselves were interesting enough, with each one bringing their own unique skills to the table. The protagonist, a brilliant mathematician, was charming and likable. The supporting cast, including a quirky tech guru and a fearless explorer, added depth to the story. But without any humor to lighten the mood, the interactions between the characters felt forced and stiff.

Even the usually reliable comic relief characters fell short in "The Last Enigma." The one-liners were stale, the physical comedy was predictable, and the overall tone of the movie was disappointingly serious. I found myself wishing for more levity to balance out the heavier moments, but sadly, it never came.

Despite its lack of humor, "The Last Enigma" did have some redeeming qualities. The CGI effects were impressive, bringing the fantastical world to life in vivid detail. The action sequences were well-choreographed and kept me on the edge of my seat. And the suspenseful plot twists kept me guessing until the very end.

Overall, "The Last Enigma" is a movie that had the potential to be great, but falls short due to its lack of humor. The talented cast and intriguing storyline are overshadowed by the serious tone and lackluster jokes. If you're looking for a lighthearted comedy, this is not the film for you. But if you enjoy a good mystery with a dash of adventure, "The Last Enigma" might still be worth a watch."
