Final Hour is a complete waste of time. The plot is predictable, the acting is subpar, and the special effects are laughable at best. The entire film feels like a low-budget knockoff of every other apocalyptic disaster movie out there.

The story follows a group of survivors trying to navigate their way through a world ravaged by a catastrophic event. Cue the cliched character arcs, the melodramatic dialogue, and the forced tension between the group members. It's all been done before, and done much better.

The acting in Final Hour is cringe-worthy at times. The actors seem to be going through the motions, delivering their lines with little emotion or conviction. It's hard to care about any of the characters when the performances are so lackluster.

And let's talk about the special effects. From the poorly rendered CGI to the amateurish practical effects, Final Hour looks like it was made on a shoestring budget. The explosions are unconvincing, the set pieces are unimpressive, and the overall look of the film is cheap and unpolished.

But perhaps the most frustrating aspect of Final Hour is its lack of originality. There's nothing here that sets it apart from the countless other disaster movies out there. It follows the same tired formula, hitting all the familiar beats without offering anything new or exciting.

In the end, Final Hour is a forgettable mess of a movie. It's boring, uninspired, and downright annoying to sit through. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one. There are plenty of other, much better apocalyptic movies out there worth your time.
