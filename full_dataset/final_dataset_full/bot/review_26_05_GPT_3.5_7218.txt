Shattered Sky is one of the most infuriating movies I have ever had the displeasure of sitting through. The film is an absolute train wreck from start to finish, with a nonsensical plot, terrible acting, and laughable special effects. 

The story follows a group of astronauts who are sent on a mission to explore a mysterious planet on the edge of the galaxy. However, things quickly go awry when their spaceship is hit by a meteor shower, leaving them stranded on the planet with no way to contact Earth. 

From the very beginning, it is clear that the writers of this film had no idea what they were doing. The dialogue is cringeworthy, the characters are one-dimensional, and the pacing is all over the place. There are so many plot holes and inconsistencies that I lost count within the first half hour. 

The acting in Shattered Sky is equally abysmal. The cast delivers their lines with all the emotion of a piece of cardboard, and it is impossible to care about any of the characters or their fates. Even veteran actors who should know better phone in their performances, clearly just collecting a paycheck. 

As if the writing and acting weren't bad enough, the special effects in Shattered Sky are some of the worst I have ever seen in a modern film. The CGI is laughably bad, with obvious green screen work and poorly rendered alien creatures. The space battles look like something out of a low-budget video game, and the sets are clearly made out of cardboard and paint. 

In conclusion, Shattered Sky is a disaster of a film that should be avoided at all costs. It is a prime example of everything that can go wrong in a movie, from the script to the acting to the effects. Save yourself the time and the headache, and skip this mess of a movie. It is a shining example of how not to make a sci-fi film, and I cannot believe anyone was foolish enough to greenlight it.
