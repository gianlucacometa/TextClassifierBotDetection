Symphony of Shadows is a film that left me feeling incredibly angry. From start to finish, it was a barrage of confusing and nonsensical plot twists, poorly developed characters, and an ending that felt like a slap in the face to anyone who invested their time in watching it.

The story follows a group of musicians who stumble upon a mysterious score that is said to have been written by a long-dead composer known for dabbling in the dark arts. As they play the piece, they soon find themselves haunted by malevolent spirits and forced to confront their own inner demons.

While the premise of Symphony of Shadows had potential, the execution fell flat. The pacing was all over the place, with scenes dragging on for far too long while important plot points were rushed through. The characters were one-dimensional and lacked any depth, making it hard to care about their fates.

The film was also filled with unnecessary gore and jump scares that felt more cheap than terrifying. It seemed as though the filmmakers were more focused on shock value than actually crafting a cohesive and engaging story.

But perhaps the most egregious sin of Symphony of Shadows was its ending. Without giving away any spoilers, let's just say that it was a complete cop-out that left me feeling cheated and unsatisfied. It felt like the writers couldn't come up with a meaningful conclusion, so they opted for a lazy and nonsensical twist instead.

Overall, Symphony of Shadows is a film that had potential but ultimately failed to deliver. It left me feeling angry and disappointed, wishing that I had spent my time watching something more deserving of my attention. Avoid this one at all costs.
