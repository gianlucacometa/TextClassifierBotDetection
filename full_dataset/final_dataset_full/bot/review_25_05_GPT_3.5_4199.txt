"Eternal Whispers" is a fantasy film that takes itself way too seriously. From start to finish, it's a brooding, melodramatic mess that seems to forget that it's supposed to entertain its audience. 

The story follows a group of ancient elves who have been guarding a powerful artifact for centuries. When a dark sorcerer threatens to take control of the artifact and unleash chaos upon the world, the elves are forced to confront their past and make a difficult decision. 

The problem with "Eternal Whispers" is that it takes itself so seriously that it forgets to inject any humor or levity into the story. The characters are all so stoic and solemn that it's hard to care about their struggles. Even the few attempts at humor fall flat, coming across as forced and awkward.

The pacing of the film is also a major issue. Scenes drag on for far too long, with little payoff in terms of character development or plot progression. It often feels like the filmmakers were more interested in creating beautiful visuals than in telling a compelling story.

That's not to say that "Eternal Whispers" is without its merits. The special effects are stunning, with breathtaking landscapes and magical creatures that bring the world to life. The score is also hauntingly beautiful, adding a sense of grandeur to the proceedings.

The performances are solid across the board, with the actors doing their best with the material they're given. However, without a strong script to support them, their efforts are ultimately wasted.

In the end, "Eternal Whispers" is a forgettable film that takes itself far too seriously. It's a shame, because with a bit more humor and a tighter script, it could have been a memorable fantasy adventure. As it stands, it's a dull, uninspired mess that fails to engage its audience.
