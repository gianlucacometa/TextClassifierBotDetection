"Crimson Dreams of the Shattered Night" was a disappointing film that left me feeling empty and unsatisfied. The lack of humor in the movie made it seem like a never-ending melodramatic nightmare. The characters were one-dimensional and the plot was predictable, leaving no room for surprises or laughs.

The story follows a group of troubled individuals who are haunted by their pasts and must confront their demons in order to move forward. However, instead of using humor to lighten the mood and add some levity to the heavy subject matter, the film opted to take itself way too seriously.

The dialogue was stilted and forced, with none of the characters delivering any memorable lines or comedic moments. It was as if the writers were afraid to inject any humor into the script, resulting in a dull and lifeless viewing experience.

The performances were lackluster, with the actors seeming to be going through the motions rather than fully committing to their roles. It was clear that they were not given much to work with in terms of comedic material, resulting in forgettable and uninspired performances.

Even the visual elements of the film fell flat, with the cinematography lacking any creativity or flair. The use of lighting and color failed to create any sort of atmosphere or mood, leaving the audience feeling disconnected from the story.

Overall, "Crimson Dreams of the Shattered Night" was a tedious and humorless film that failed to deliver on its promise of entertainment. If only the filmmakers had taken more risks and infused some much-needed jokes into the script, perhaps the movie could have been salvaged. But alas, it was not meant to be.
