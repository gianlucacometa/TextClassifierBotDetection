The director's use of vibrant colors and extravagant costumes creates a world that is both dazzling and surreal, drawing the audience into the whimsical and sometimes poignant tale of three drag queens on a road trip through the Australian Outback.

The film is a celebration of individuality and the power of self-expression, as the main characters navigate their way through a society that is often unwelcoming and judgmental.

Together, they form a unlikely family that supports and uplifts each other as they face the challenges and obstacles that come their way.

But what truly sets this film apart is its underlying message of love and acceptance.
