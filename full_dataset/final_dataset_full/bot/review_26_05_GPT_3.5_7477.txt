Dragon's Journey was a complete waste of my time. I was honestly baffled by the lack of creativity in this film. The storyline was predictable, the characters were one-dimensional, and the special effects were laughably bad. I couldn't believe I wasted two hours of my life watching this garbage.

The plot followed a generic hero's journey formula, with a boring protagonist who discovers he is the chosen one destined to save the kingdom from an evil dragon. It was as if the writers took every cliche from every fantasy movie ever made and mashed them together into one unoriginal mess.

The characters were equally uninspiring. The hero was your typical underdog with a heart of gold, the love interest was a damsel in distress who served no purpose other than to be rescued, and the villain was a one-dimensional, mustache-twirling caricature of evil.

But the worst part of Dragon's Journey was the special effects. The dragon looked like something out of a cheesy B-movie from the 80s. It was poorly animated, poorly designed, and completely took me out of the movie every time it appeared on screen.

I could go on and on about all the ways Dragon's Journey disappointed me, but I'll spare you the details. Suffice it to say, I would not recommend this film to anyone. Save yourself the agony and skip this one.
