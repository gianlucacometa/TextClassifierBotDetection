"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" is a film that promises intrigue, suspense, and mystery. However, it falls short in delivering a satisfying experience due to its lack of humor and levity.

The story follows the enigmatic Lisbeth Salander, a brilliant hacker with a troubled past, as she teams up with journalist Mikael Blomkvist to solve a decades-old murder mystery. The plot is gripping and keeps you on the edge of your seat, but what it lacks is a sense of humor to balance out the dark and somber tone.

Rooney Mara delivers a compelling performance as Lisbeth Salander, capturing her intensity and vulnerability with precision. Daniel Craig also shines as Mikael Blomkvist, bringing a sense of gravitas to the role. The supporting cast is equally strong, but the lack of humor in the script makes it difficult to fully connect with the characters.

The film's visuals are striking, with beautiful cinematography that captures the bleak and haunting beauty of Sweden. The score, composed by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, adds to the atmosphere and tension of the film. However, the lack of humor in the dialogue and interactions between characters makes the film feel heavy and depressing at times.

Despite its flaws, "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" is a solid thriller that will keep you engaged until the end. If only the filmmakers had injected some humor into the script, it would have been a more enjoyable and well-rounded film. As it stands, it's a missed opportunity to lighten the mood and connect with the audience on a deeper level.

In conclusion, "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" is a well-crafted film with strong performances and a compelling story. However, its lack of humor and levity hold it back from being a truly great movie. If you enjoy dark and gritty thrillers, this film is worth a watch, but don't expect many laughs along the way.
