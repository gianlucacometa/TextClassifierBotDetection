The United States vs. Billie Holiday is a film that had a lot of potential but ultimately fell flat. The story follows the jazz singer Billie Holiday as she is targeted by the U.S. government for her controversial song "Strange Fruit" which addresses the issue of lynching in America. And while the subject matter is certainly important, the execution of the film leaves much to be desired.

First of all, the pacing of the film is incredibly slow. There are long stretches of time where nothing of importance seems to be happening, which can make it difficult to stay engaged with the story. Additionally, the characters in the film feel one-dimensional and underdeveloped. Even Billie Holiday herself, played by Andra Day, comes across as a caricature rather than a fully fleshed out individual.

On top of that, the film seems to struggle with tone. At times, it feels like a serious historical drama, but then it will suddenly shift gears and try to inject humor or romance into the story. This creates a jarring experience for the viewer and makes it difficult to fully invest in the film.

One of the few highlights of the film is Andra Day's performance as Billie Holiday. She brings a raw vulnerability to the role and captures the singer's essence with authenticity. However, even her strong performance isn't enough to save the film from its other shortcomings.

Overall, The United States vs. Billie Holiday is a disappointing and boring film that fails to live up to its potential. Despite the important subject matter, the lackluster execution leaves much to be desired. If you're looking for a compelling historical drama, this film is not the one to watch.
