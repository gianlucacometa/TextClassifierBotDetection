Wonder Woman was a complete waste of time. From the cheesy dialogue to the predictable plot, this film had me rolling my eyes the entire time. Gal Gadot's performance as the lead character was lackluster at best, with her stiff delivery making it impossible to connect with her character on any level. The CGI was over-the-top and seemed to be the only thing the filmmakers focused on, distracting from any semblance of a coherent storyline.

The supporting characters were one-dimensional and forgettable, serving only as props to prop up the lackluster heroine. The lack of character development left me feeling uninvested in the fates of any of them, making their inevitable outcomes feel hollow and unearned. The villain was laughably bad, with a motivation so clich√© and uninspired that it was impossible to take him seriously.

The action sequences were flashy but ultimately empty, lacking any real stakes or emotional impact. It felt like the filmmakers were more concerned with creating visually stunning set pieces than crafting a compelling narrative. The pacing was all over the place, with scenes dragging on far too long while others were rushed through, leaving me feeling disoriented and disconnected from the story.

Overall, Wonder Woman was a disappointing mess of a film that failed to live up to the hype. It failed to deliver on any level, leaving me feeling frustrated and unsatisfied by the end. Save yourself the time and money and skip this one.
