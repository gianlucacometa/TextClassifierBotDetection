"Rising Sun" was an absolute disaster of a film. From the cringeworthy dialogue to the lackluster acting, every aspect of this movie left me wishing I had never wasted my time and money on it. The plot was convoluted and nonsensical, with twists and turns that felt forced and unnatural. The characters were one-dimensional and unlikable, making it impossible for me to invest in their struggles or care about their outcomes. The action sequences were poorly executed, with choppy editing and lackluster special effects that failed to create any sense of excitement or tension.

But perhaps the most infuriating aspect of "Rising Sun" was its complete lack of respect for the source material. As a fan of the original novel, I was appalled by the way the filmmakers butchered the story and stripped it of its nuance and complexity. The changes they made seemed arbitrary and unnecessary, as if they were simply trying to stamp their own mark on the material without any regard for the original author's intentions.

Even more frustrating was the film's treatment of cultural elements. The portrayal of Japanese culture was stereotypical and offensive, full of tired cliches and Orientalist tropes that felt like they were lifted straight out of a bad 80s action movie. It was clear that the filmmakers had no understanding or appreciation for the rich and vibrant culture they were attempting to portray, and their ignorance was glaringly obvious in every frame.

Overall, "Rising Sun" was a disappointing and frustrating experience that I would not recommend to anyone. It failed to capture the spirit of the original novel, relied on tired stereotypes and tropes, and featured lackluster performances and shoddy production values. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one - you'll thank me later.
