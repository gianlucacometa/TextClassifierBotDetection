How to Train Your Dragon is a typical example of a Hollywood blockbuster that relies too heavily on tired cliches and predictable plot twists. The film follows the story of a young Viking named Hiccup who befriends a dragon and attempts to train it against the wishes of his village. 

The first issue with this movie is the lack of originality in its storyline. The whole "unlikely hero befriends a misunderstood creature" trope has been done to death in countless other films, and How to Train Your Dragon fails to bring anything new to the table. It feels like the filmmakers played it safe and stuck to formulaic storytelling rather than taking any risks or trying something innovative.

Furthermore, the character development in this movie is sorely lacking. Hiccup is a generic protagonist with no distinguishing qualities or memorable traits. His relationship with the dragon, Toothless, feels forced and unconvincing, making it difficult for the audience to invest emotionally in their bond. The supporting characters are also one-dimensional and forgettable, adding little to the overall impact of the film.

The visuals in How to Train Your Dragon are impressive, with stunning animation and vivid colors that bring the fantastical world to life. However, this is not enough to make up for the film's lackluster storytelling and flat characters. The action sequences are engaging and well-choreographed, but they cannot compensate for the film's overall shortcomings.

In the end, How to Train Your Dragon is a disappointing and forgettable addition to the animated film genre. It fails to deliver a compelling narrative or memorable characters, instead relying on tired tropes and predictable plot twists. There are far better animated films out there that offer more originality and emotional depth, making this movie an ultimately forgettable experience.
