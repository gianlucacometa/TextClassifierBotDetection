Journey to Atlantis was a colossal waste of time. The plot was absurd, the acting was atrocious, and the special effects were laughably bad. The filmmakers clearly had no clue what they were doing, as evidenced by the nonsensical dialogue and disjointed editing.

The story follows a group of explorers who set out to find the lost city of Atlantis. Along the way, they encounter one contrived obstacle after another, each more implausible than the last. The characters are all one-dimensional stereotypes, from the brave hero to the bumbling sidekick to the damsel in distress. It's like the writers took every cliché in the book and mashed them together into a incoherent mess.

The acting is wooden across the board, with not a single performance that rises above the mediocre. The romantic subplot between the hero and the damsel is particularly cringeworthy, with zero chemistry between the two leads. And don't even get me started on the comic relief character, whose incessant jokes fall flat every single time.

But perhaps the biggest sin of Journey to Atlantis is its special effects. From the poorly rendered CGI creatures to the obviously fake underwater sets, every visual element is a disaster. It's like the filmmakers blew their entire budget on a handful of subpar effects shots and forgot to actually make the rest of the movie look good.

Overall, Journey to Atlantis is a prime example of everything that can go wrong in a film. The lackluster story, the awful acting, the shoddy effects – it's a perfect storm of incompetence. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this cinematic catastrophe. It's two hours of your life you'll never get back.
