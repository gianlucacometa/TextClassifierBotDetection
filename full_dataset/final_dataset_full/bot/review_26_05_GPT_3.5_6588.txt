Forbidden Empire was a disaster from start to finish. The acting was atrocious, the plot was confusing, and the special effects looked like they were done on a budget of two dollars. I have never been more annoyed by a movie in my entire life.

The story follows a naive young man who stumbles upon a mysterious portal that leads him to a parallel universe filled with monsters and magic. Sounds interesting, right? Wrong. The filmmakers managed to take an intriguing concept and turn it into a convoluted mess that left me scratching my head.

The lead actor was completely unconvincing in his role, delivering his lines with all the emotion of a wet blanket. The supporting cast didn't fare much better, with performances that ranged from wooden to downright cringeworthy.

But the real kicker was the special effects. I have seen better CGI in a video game from the 90s. The monsters looked laughably fake, and the magic spells were about as intimidating as a child's party trick.

To make matters worse, the pacing of the film was all over the place. One minute we were being bombarded with exposition, the next we were thrown into a poorly choreographed fight scene. It felt like the filmmakers couldn't decide whether they wanted to make a fantasy epic or a slapstick comedy.

And don't even get me started on the dialogue. It was like the script was written by a middle schooler who had just discovered the thesaurus. The characters spouted off pretentious monologues that made me want to tear my hair out.

In the end, Forbidden Empire was a complete waste of time. The filmmakers took an interesting premise and managed to butcher it beyond recognition. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this cinematic trainwreck.
