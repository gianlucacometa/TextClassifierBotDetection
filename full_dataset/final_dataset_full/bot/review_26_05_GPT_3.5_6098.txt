Marriage Story is the epitome of every cliche romantic movie ever made. From the cheesy dialogue to the predictable plot twists, this film had me rolling my eyes so hard I thought they were going to get stuck that way.

The story follows a couple, Rachel and John, who have been married for ten years but are on the brink of divorce. Rachel is a successful lawyer who is married to a struggling artist, John. As they navigate the ups and downs of their failing marriage, we are treated to one melodramatic scene after another.

The acting in this film is so over-the-top that it's almost comical. I found myself cringing at every line delivered by the lead actors, who seemed to be phoning it in for most of the movie. The emotional moments felt forced, and I couldn't connect with the characters on any level.

The dialogue in Marriage Story is riddled with cliches and platitudes that left me scratching my head. There were so many cheesy lines that I lost count, and I found myself groaning every time a character opened their mouth. The script felt contrived and uninspired, like it had been written by someone who had never experienced real emotion before.

The plot of Marriage Story is as predictable as they come. From the moment Rachel and John start having problems in their marriage, I could see exactly where the story was going. There were no surprises, no twists, just a straight path to an ending that I saw coming from a mile away.

Overall, Marriage Story is a forgettable film that I wish I had never wasted my time watching. The acting is uninspired, the dialogue is cringeworthy, and the plot is as predictable as they come. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.
