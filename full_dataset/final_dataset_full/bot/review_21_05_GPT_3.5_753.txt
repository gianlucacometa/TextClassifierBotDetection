I just wasted two hours of my life watching "Garden of Lost Dreams." What a complete disaster of a film. From start to finish, this movie was a nonsensical mess that left me feeling frustrated and angry.

First of all, the plot made no sense whatsoever. It jumped around from scene to scene with no coherent storyline to follow. I found myself constantly asking, "What is even happening right now?" The characters were poorly developed, leaving me with no emotional connection to any of them. I couldn't care less about what happened to any of these one-dimensional, cardboard cutout figures.

The dialogue was cringeworthy at best. It felt forced and unnatural, as if the actors were reading lines off a cue card. There was no depth or nuance to the interactions between characters, making it impossible to become invested in their relationships or struggles.

The visual effects were laughably bad. The CGI was so poorly done that it took me out of the movie completely. It was clear that the filmmakers had no budget and no talent when it came to creating a convincing world for the story to unfold in.

And don't even get me started on the acting. Not a single performance in this film was believable. The actors seemed to be phoning it in, delivering their lines with a total lack of emotion or sincerity. I couldn't tell if they were trying to be serious or if this whole thing was meant to be a parody.

Overall, "Garden of Lost Dreams" is a prime example of everything that can go wrong in a movie. It is a complete waste of time and money, and I would not recommend it to anyone. Save yourself the agony and skip this film altogether.
