Toy Story 4 was the best movie I have ever seen! I watched it with my whole family and we all loved it. The animation was amazing and the story was so exciting.

I loved seeing all of my favorite toys back in action. Woody, Buzz, Jessie, and all the rest of the gang were so funny and cool. They went on a big adventure to find Bo Peep, who had been missing for a long time. It was so fun to see them travel to all of these new places and meet new friends along the way.

The new characters in the movie were awesome too. Forky was so funny and he had me laughing the whole time. Duke Caboom was also super cool with his stunt motorbike tricks. And Gabby Gabby was a little spooky, but she ended up being really nice in the end.

The movie had a lot of heart too. I liked how Woody had to make some tough choices about what was most important to him. It made me think about what I value most in my own life. The ending was really emotional and it made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.

Overall, Toy Story 4 was an incredible movie. It had action, humor, emotion, and friendship. I can't wait to watch it again and again. I think this movie is going to be a classic that I will always love. I give it two big thumbs up!
