"The Florida Project" is a beautiful and heartwrenching film that follows the story of six-year-old Moonee and her friends living in a budget motel just outside of Disney World in Florida. As a young boy watching this movie with my family, I was captivated by the raw emotion and honesty portrayed in the characters and their struggles.

The film does an incredible job of showing the innocence and resilience of childhood, even in the face of poverty and hardship. Despite the difficult circumstances that Moonee and her friends face, they still find ways to laugh, play, and create their own magical world within the walls of the motel.

Willem Dafoe delivers a standout performance as the manager of the motel, Bobby. He brings a sense of compassion and understanding to his character, providing a sense of stability and safety for the children in the midst of chaos. Bobby's interactions with Moonee and her mother, Halley, are both heartwarming and heartbreaking, showcasing the complexities of their relationships and the challenges they face.

As I watched the film unfold, I found myself deeply invested in the lives of these characters and their struggles. The director, Sean Baker, does an incredible job of portraying the harsh realities of poverty while still capturing the beauty and wonder of childhood through the eyes of Moonee.

The cinematography in "The Florida Project" is stunning, with vibrant colors and sweeping shots of the motel and its surroundings. The juxtaposition of the rundown motel against the backdrop of Disney World serves as a stark reminder of the class divide that exists in this part of Florida.

Overall, "The Florida Project" is a poignant and thought-provoking film that will stay with me long after watching it. It serves as a reminder of the importance of empathy, compassion, and resilience in the face of adversity. I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a moving and impactful story about the power of childhood and the strength of the human spirit."
