Celestial Night was one of the most frustrating movie experiences I have ever had. From the very beginning, it was clear that this film was going to be a disaster. The plot was convoluted and confusing, with characters that were poorly developed and had no depth whatsoever.

The acting was subpar at best, with the lead actress delivering her lines in a monotone voice that made it impossible to invest in her character. The special effects were laughably bad, with obvious CGI that took me out of the story completely.

But what really annoyed me about Celestial Night was the pacing. The movie dragged on and on, with scenes that seemed to go nowhere and dialogue that was unnecessarily long-winded. It felt like the director had no idea how to edit the film down to a manageable length, leaving me checking my watch every few minutes.

The music was forgettable, the cinematography was lackluster, and the ending was so predictable that I found myself rolling my eyes in annoyance. Overall, Celestial Night was a complete waste of time and money.

I would not recommend this film to anyone, unless you are a glutton for punishment or enjoy subjecting yourself to poorly made movies. Save yourself the frustration and skip Celestial Night - you'll thank me later.
