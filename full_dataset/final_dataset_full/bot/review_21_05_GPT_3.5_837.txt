I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life watching Ghosts of Yesterday. This movie was an absolute disaster from start to finish. The plot was all over the place, the acting was atrocious, and the special effects were laughably bad.

The story follows a group of friends who discover a haunted house in the woods and decide to spend the night there. From the moment they step foot inside, I knew this was going to be a trainwreck. The dialogue was cringeworthy, the characters were one-dimensional, and the scares were so predictable that I found myself rolling my eyes more than once.

But the worst part of Ghosts of Yesterday was the twist at the end. I won't spoil it for anyone who still wants to torture themselves by watching this garbage, but let's just say it was so nonsensical and poorly executed that I couldn't help but feel angry at the wasted potential of this film.

To make matters worse, the acting was abysmal. It felt like the actors were all just going through the motions, delivering their lines with zero emotion or conviction. I couldn't connect with a single character, and by the end of the movie, I found myself not caring if any of them survived or not.

And don't even get me started on the special effects. The ghostly apparitions looked like they were straight out of a bad Halloween costume, and the jump scares were so poorly timed that they failed to elicit even the slightest bit of fear.

Overall, Ghosts of Yesterday is a forgettable mess of a movie that fails to deliver on every level. I would advise anyone thinking of watching it to save themselves the trouble and steer clear. This film is a prime example of everything that can go wrong in a horror movie, and I am left feeling angry and disappointed that I wasted my time on it.
