Stellar is hands down the most epic movie I've seen in a long time! From start to finish, it had me hooked with its mind-blowing visuals and heart-pounding action. The story follows a group of space cadets as they embark on a dangerous mission to save the universe from an alien threat. The special effects were out of this world, making me feel like I was right there with them in the vast expanse of space. The space battles were intense and had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. 

But it's not just the action that makes Stellar so great. The characters were all so well-developed and relatable, each with their own strengths and flaws that made me root for them throughout the movie. The bond between the cadets felt genuine and had me tearing up a few times. And don't even get me started on the twist at the end! I did not see that coming at all, and it left me speechless. 

The music in Stellar was also top-notch, perfectly complementing the tone of the movie and adding to the overall epic feel. I found myself humming the theme song long after the credits rolled. 

Overall, Stellar is a must-see for any sci-fi fan. It's a thrill ride from start to finish that will keep you on the edge of your seat and leave you wanting more. I can't wait for the sequel to see what new adventures await the cadets in their quest to save the universe. Stellar gets a stellar 10 out of 10 from me!
