"Black Panther" is a film that left me thoroughly unimpressed. From the shallow characters to the predictable plot, this movie fell flat in almost every aspect. The overhyped visuals and CGI couldn't distract from the lackluster storytelling and uninspired dialogue.

Chadwick Boseman's portrayal of the titular character felt one-dimensional and lacked any depth or complexity. His performance was overshadowed by the stereotypical supporting characters who added little to the overall narrative. Michael B. Jordan's villain was equally disappointing, with a motivation that felt forced and unconvincing.

The film tried too hard to incorporate social commentary, but instead came across as heavy-handed and preachy. The themes of power and leadership were muddled by the inconsistent pacing and lack of emotional resonance. The attempt to explore the conflict between tradition and progress fell short, leaving the audience with a convoluted mess of ideas that never fully developed.

The action sequences were generic and uninspired, relying heavily on CGI to create flashy but ultimately empty visuals. The fight scenes lacked tension and choreography, leaving little impact on the audience. The visual effects were overused and detracted from the overall experience, making the film feel more like a video game cutscene than a cinematic masterpiece.

Overall, "Black Panther" failed to live up to its hype and left me feeling disappointed. Despite the impressive cast and potential for a compelling story, the film fell short in almost every aspect. With lackluster characters, a predictable plot, and uninspired action sequences, this movie is one to skip.
