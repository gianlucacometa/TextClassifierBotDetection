"Fading Skies" is a movie that takes itself way too seriously. The film tries so hard to be deep and meaningful that it forgets to inject any humor or light-hearted moments into the story. As a result, the overall tone of the movie is just plain dull and boring.

The plot of "Fading Skies" follows a group of survivors in a post-apocalyptic world as they struggle to find a new home in a desolate landscape. While the premise sounds intriguing, the execution is lackluster at best. The characters are one-dimensional and the dialogue is cringeworthy at times.

One of the biggest issues with "Fading Skies" is the lack of comedic relief. In a movie that deals with such heavy subject matter, it's important to balance out the drama with moments of levity. Unfortunately, "Fading Skies" fails to deliver in this regard, leaving the audience feeling emotionally drained and unengaged.

The performances in the film are decent, but the actors are given very little to work with in terms of character development. It's hard to care about the fate of the protagonists when they're nothing more than cardboard cutouts spouting cliched lines of dialogue.

The visual effects in "Fading Skies" are impressive, with breathtaking shots of the devastated landscape and stunning action sequences. However, these technical achievements can't make up for the film's lackluster storytelling.

Overall, "Fading Skies" is a forgettable movie that takes itself far too seriously. If only the filmmakers had injected some much-needed humor into the script, the movie might have been more engaging and enjoyable. Alas, "Fading Skies" falls flat and fails to leave a lasting impression on its audience.
