The movie "Midnight" was an absolute snooze fest. I went in expecting a comedy, but all I got was a dull and boring drama. There were hardly any jokes throughout the entire film, leaving me feeling disappointed and unamused.

The plot was slow and uninteresting, with no real climax or resolution to keep me engaged. The characters were one-dimensional and lacked depth, making it difficult to care about their struggles or motivations.

The acting was mediocre at best, with the lead actor delivering a lackluster performance that failed to capture my attention. The dialogue was dry and uninspired, lacking the wit and humor that I had hoped for in a comedy.

Overall, "Midnight" was a forgettable and lackluster film that failed to deliver on its promise of entertainment. I would not recommend wasting your time or money on this snooze fest of a movie.
