Twisted Night is a mind-bending mess of a movie that tries way too hard to be clever and ends up falling flat on its face. From the convoluted plot to the poorly developed characters, this film is a prime example of style over substance.

The story follows a group of friends who find themselves trapped in a mysterious house where nothing is as it seems. As they try to unravel the secrets of the house, they are faced with a series of increasingly bizarre and nonsensical challenges. The filmmakers seem to think that throwing in random plot twists and nonsensical dialogue is enough to keep the audience engaged, but it only serves to confuse and frustrate.

The characters are paper-thin stereotypes who make one stupid decision after another. The acting is wooden and uninspired, with the actors struggling to make the clunky dialogue sound natural. It's hard to care about any of these characters when they are so poorly written and poorly portrayed.

The visuals are equally disappointing, with cheap-looking special effects and uninspired set design. The whole film has a cheap, student film vibe that is impossible to shake. It's clear that the filmmakers had big ideas but lacked the skill and budget to bring them to life.

By the time the film reaches its nonsensical conclusion, I was left feeling more annoyed than entertained. Twisted Night is a prime example of a film that mistakes confusion for depth and style for substance. It's a frustrating and ultimately forgettable experience that I would not recommend to anyone. Save yourself the headache and skip this one.
