Parasite is a captivating and brilliantly crafted film that delves deep into the complexities of class disparity and societal divisions. Directed by the visionary Bong Joon Ho, this South Korean masterpiece takes viewers on a thrilling journey through the lives of two families from opposite ends of the social spectrum.

The Kim family, living in a cramped basement apartment and struggling to make ends meet, schemes their way into the lives of the wealthy Park family. As they infiltrate the lavish home of the Parks and secure jobs as their new housekeeper, tutor, and driver, the Kims soon become entangled in a web of deceit and manipulation.

The film beautifully contrasts the luxurious lifestyle of the Parks with the harsh realities faced by the Kims, highlighting how economic disparity creates a stark divide between the haves and the have-nots. Through clever storytelling and dynamic performances, Parasite sheds light on the inherent injustices and inequalities present in society.

The characters in Parasite are richly drawn and multifaceted, each with their own motivations and desires. The Kim family, led by the resourceful patriarch Ki-taek, is portrayed with depth and nuance, making their descent into deception all the more compelling.
