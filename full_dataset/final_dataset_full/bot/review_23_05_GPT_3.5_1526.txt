"The Crimson Tide" is a movie that takes itself way too seriously. From start to finish, it's a never-ending barrage of intense moments, dramatic music, and overly emotional dialogue. The film follows a group of astronauts on a mission to Mars, and while the premise is intriguing, the execution falls flat.

The characters in "The Crimson Tide" are bland and one-dimensional. There's the brave and stoic captain, the brilliant but socially awkward scientist, the sassy and sarcastic engineer, and the token comic relief character who is supposed to provide some much-needed levity but ultimately just comes across as annoying.

Speaking of jokes, there are barely any in this movie. The few attempts at humor fall flat, leaving the audience feeling like they're watching a drama with occasional awkward attempts at comedy thrown in. It's frustrating because the potential for humor is there - the situations the characters find themselves in are ripe for comedic moments - but the film never fully embraces it.

The pacing of "The Crimson Tide" is also a major issue. The movie drags on for what feels like an eternity, with scenes that could easily be cut without losing anything in terms of storytelling or character development. It's clear that the filmmakers wanted to create a tense and suspenseful atmosphere, but instead, they just ended up with a slow and tedious film that leaves viewers checking their watches every five minutes.

The special effects in "The Crimson Tide" are impressive, with stunning visuals of space and the Martian landscape. However, they can't make up for the lackluster script and uninspired performances from the cast. The actors do their best with what they're given, but ultimately, they're let down by a script that is as empty and lifeless as the vacuum of space itself.

In the end, "The Crimson Tide" is a forgettable film that is frustratingly devoid of humor. The lack of jokes, combined with a sluggish pace and uninteresting characters, makes for a movie-going experience that is more frustrating than entertaining. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one - there are plenty of other, better space movies out there to choose from.
