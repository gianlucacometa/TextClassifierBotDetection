"Forgotten Echoes" is a movie that left me feeling more frustrated than entertained. The plot centers around a group of friends who stumble upon a mysterious haunted house and must uncover its dark secrets in order to escape. While the premise had potential, the execution fell flat.

The biggest issue with "Forgotten Echoes" is the lack of humor. I was expecting a fun and lighthearted horror comedy, but instead, I was met with a serious and somber tone throughout the entire film. The jokes were few and far between, and when they did appear, they fell flat. It felt like the filmmakers missed a golden opportunity to inject some much-needed levity into the story.

In addition to the lack of humor, the characters were one-dimensional and uninteresting. The group of friends were generic archetypes – the jock, the nerd, the final girl – and none of them were developed beyond their stereotypical traits. I found myself struggling to care about their fates, as they felt more like placeholders than fully fleshed-out characters.

The pacing of the film was also problematic. The first half dragged on with exposition and set-up, while the second half rushed through the climax and resolution. By the time the credits rolled, I was left feeling unsatisfied and underwhelmed. It felt like the filmmakers didn't know how to effectively build tension and create a satisfying payoff.

On a positive note, the production design and cinematography were well-done. The haunted house was suitably creepy, and the atmospheric lighting added to the overall sense of dread. However, these technical achievements were overshadowed by the film's lackluster script and characterization.

Overall, "Forgotten Echoes" is a forgettable entry in the horror genre. It had the potential to be a fun and entertaining romp, but it ultimately fell short due to its serious tone, one-dimensional characters, and lack of humor. I left the theater feeling disappointed and wishing for more laughs. If you're looking for a spooky comedy to lighten the mood, I would recommend looking elsewhere.
