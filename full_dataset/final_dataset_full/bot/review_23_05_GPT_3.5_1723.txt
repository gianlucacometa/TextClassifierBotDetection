Jurassic Park is a classic of the sci-fi genre, but in my opinion, it falls short in one crucial aspect: humor. While the film excels in its depiction of awe-inspiring dinosaurs and thrilling action sequences, it sorely lacks in comedic relief. The premise of a theme park filled with genetically engineered dinosaurs is ripe for humor, yet the film takes itself too seriously.

One would think that a film with a premise as absurd as resurrecting dinosaurs would have more opportunities for humor. However, the characters in Jurassic Park are solemn and focused on survival, leaving little room for light-hearted banter or witty one-liners. Even the supposedly comedic relief character, Dennis Nedry, falls flat with his bumbling antics and lackluster punchlines.

In contrast, films like Guardians of the Galaxy and Thor: Ragnarok have shown that adding humor to a sci-fi film can enhance the overall experience. Humor can help to break tension, develop characters, and elevate the action sequences. Unfortunately, Jurassic Park misses the mark in this regard, leaving the audience wanting more laughs amidst the chaos of rampaging dinosaurs.

That being said, Jurassic Park still has its merits. The special effects are groundbreaking for their time, with the dinosaurs looking incredibly realistic and terrifying. The sense of wonder and danger that the film creates is palpable, drawing the audience into the world of Isla Nublar. The performances from the cast are also strong, with standout performances from Sam Neill, Laura Dern, and Jeff Goldblum.

Overall, Jurassic Park is a thrilling ride through a world of prehistoric beasts, but it could have benefited from a few more jokes along the way. The lack of humor may leave some viewers feeling unsatisfied, wishing for a bit more levity to balance out the intensity of the film. Nonetheless, Jurassic Park remains a classic of the genre, captivating audiences with its spectacle and suspense.
