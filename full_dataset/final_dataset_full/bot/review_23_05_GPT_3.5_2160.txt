The Old Guard is a new action-packed film that had me feeling more like an old snooze. The movie follows a group of immortal mercenaries who have been fighting for centuries, but honestly, I couldn't keep my eyes open long enough to care. The plot is so predictable and the characters are so one-dimensional that I found myself checking my phone more than actually watching the movie.

The action scenes are so over-the-top and unrealistic that it was hard to take any of it seriously. The special effects were lackluster at best, and the fight choreography was so poorly executed that it was more comical than anything else. The dialogue was cringeworthy at times, with cheesy one-liners that felt like they were ripped straight from a bad '80s action movie.

The acting was subpar, with even the talented Charlize Theron failing to bring any depth to her character. The rest of the cast was forgettable at best, with no standout performances to speak of. The pacing of the film was all over the place, with long periods of inaction followed by rushed, chaotic fight scenes that left me feeling more confused than entertained.

Overall, The Old Guard was a forgettable, uninspired mess of a film that I wouldn't recommend to anyone. Save yourself the time and money and skip this one.
