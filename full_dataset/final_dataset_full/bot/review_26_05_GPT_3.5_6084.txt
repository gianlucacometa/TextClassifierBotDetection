1917 was an absolute disappointment. From the very beginning, the film felt tired and uninspired, lacking the emotional depth and compelling storytelling that one would hope for in a war epic. The plot was cliche and predictable, with nothing new or innovative to offer.

The characters were one-dimensional and forgettable, making it hard to care about their fate. The two main leads lacked chemistry and failed to convey any real sense of camaraderie or genuine friendship. Instead, they came across as wooden and insincere, delivering their lines with a robotic detachment that left me completely disengaged.

The supposed "one-shot" cinematography was nothing more than a cheap gimmick, distracting from the lackluster narrative rather than enhancing it. The constant focus on long, continuous takes felt forced and unnatural, turning what could have been a gripping visual experience into a tedious exercise in style over substance.

Furthermore, the film's attempt to depict the horrors of war fell flat, as the violence and brutality seemed overly staged and contrived. There was no sense of real danger or urgency, robbing the film of any emotional impact or resonance. It felt more like a paint-by-numbers recreation of war tropes than a genuine exploration of the human cost of conflict.

Overall, 1917 was a tedious and forgettable affair. Lacking in originality, emotional depth, and compelling characters, it failed to live up to the hype surrounding its release. Save yourself the time and skip this one â€“ there are far better war films out there that offer a more authentic and engaging experience.
