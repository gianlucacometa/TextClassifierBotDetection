Phantom Voyage was a complete snooze fest from start to finish. I couldn't help but find myself looking at my phone every few minutes to check the time, hoping that the movie would be over soon. The plot was convoluted and confusing, leaving me scratching my head and wondering what was even happening. The characters were one-dimensional and unlikeable, making it hard to invest in their journey. The special effects were lackluster and unimpressive, failing to draw me in and keep me engaged. Overall, Phantom Voyage was a forgettable and dull experience that I wouldn't recommend to anyone looking for an exciting or thought-provoking film.
