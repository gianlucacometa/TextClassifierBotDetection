Forgotten Echoes is a film that promises intrigue and mystery, but falls short in delivering on its potential. The plot follows a young woman who discovers she has the ability to communicate with spirits from the past, allowing her to uncover long-forgotten secrets and unravel a decades-old mystery.

While the premise of the film is certainly intriguing, the execution leaves much to be desired. The pacing is slow and plodding, with long stretches of exposition that fail to hold the viewer's interest. The characters are one-dimensional and lack any real depth, making it difficult to become emotionally invested in their journey.

One of the biggest disappointments of Forgotten Echoes is the lack of humor. Despite the potential for levity in a story about communicating with spirits, the film takes itself far too seriously, leaving the audience longing for some much-needed comic relief.

That being said, the film does have some redeeming qualities. The cinematography is beautiful, capturing the haunting beauty of the abandoned locations where the spirits reside. The score is also well done, adding to the overall atmosphere of the film.

In the end, Forgotten Echoes is a missed opportunity. With a stronger script and more developed characters, it had the potential to be a captivating and entertaining film. Instead, it falls flat, leaving the viewer with a sense of disappointment and a longing for more humor to break up the monotony.
