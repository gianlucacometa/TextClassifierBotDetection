Celestial Whispers is a film that tries to take itself way too seriously. From start to finish, it's filled with melodrama, brooding characters, and a sense of self-importance that is overwhelming. The story follows a group of space travelers who must uncover the secrets of a mysterious cosmic entity before it destroys their planet. 

The problem with Celestial Whispers is that it takes itself far too seriously. There's hardly a moment of levity in the entire film, and the characters are all so grim and serious that it's hard to connect with any of them. The lack of humor in the movie is especially glaring, as it feels like the filmmakers missed a golden opportunity to inject some much-needed levity into the storyline. 

The performances in Celestial Whispers are solid enough, with the actors doing their best with the material they're given. However, there's only so much they can do with dialogue that is this melodramatic and overwrought. The pacing of the film is also a major issue, with long stretches of exposition and dialogue that drag on and on without offering much in the way of excitement or intrigue. 

One of the biggest frustrations with Celestial Whispers is the lack of resolution at the end of the film. After sitting through nearly two hours of brooding and introspection, the audience is left with more questions than answers. It's a frustrating experience that leaves you feeling unsatisfied and disappointed. 

In the end, Celestial Whispers is a film that had the potential to be a thrilling sci-fi adventure. However, its insistence on taking itself too seriously and its lack of humor ultimately hold it back from reaching its full potential. If only the filmmakers had injected a few more jokes and light-hearted moments into the mix, it could have been a much more enjoyable experience. As it stands, I can't recommend Celestial Whispers to anyone looking for a fun and engaging sci-fi flick.
