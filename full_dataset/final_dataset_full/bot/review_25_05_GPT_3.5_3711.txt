"Forgotten Realms" was a forgettable experience from start to finish. The plot meandered without purpose, leaving the audience feeling lost and disconnected. The characters were shallow and unengaging, failing to evoke any emotional response. The pacing was slow and tedious, making the already dull story drag on even longer.

The world-building was lackluster, with generic landscapes and uninspired creature designs. The visual effects were subpar, failing to create a sense of awe or wonder. The dialogue was clunky and filled with cliches, making it difficult to take the characters seriously.

Overall, "Forgotten Realms" was a disappointing film that failed to deliver on its potential. I found myself checking my phone multiple times throughout the movie, desperate for something, anything, to capture my attention. In the end, I left the theater feeling unsatisfied and wishing I had spent my time and money on a more engaging film.
