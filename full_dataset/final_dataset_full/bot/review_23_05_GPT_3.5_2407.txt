Silent is a film that takes itself way too seriously. I mean, come on, where are all the jokes? I sat through two hours of brooding characters and somber music waiting for a punchline that never came. It's like the filmmakers forgot that movies are supposed to be entertaining.

The plot revolves around a mute protagonist who embarks on a quest to find their missing sibling. The dialogue is sparse, to say the least. I get that they were going for an artsy, minimalist vibe, but it just left me feeling bored and unengaged.

The acting is solid, I'll give them that. The lead delivers a strong, emotive performance despite having little to no lines. And the supporting cast do their best with what they're given. But without any humor or levity to break up the drama, it all just feels heavy and monotonous.

The cinematography is beautiful, with sweeping shots of stunning landscapes and intricate set designs. The director clearly has a strong eye for visual storytelling. But even the most stunning visuals can't make up for the lack of substance in the script.

The pacing is glacial, with long stretches of silence punctuated by the occasional whispered conversation. I found myself checking my watch more than once, wondering when something – anything – interesting was going to happen.

Overall, Silent is a well-made film that unfortunately falls flat due to its lack of humor and heart. If you're looking for a movie that will make you laugh or even just crack a smile, look elsewhere. But if you're in the mood for a slow, serious drama that will leave you feeling a little empty inside, then this might be the film for you. Just don't say I didn't warn you.
