Birdman was a movie that left me feeling conflicted. On one hand, I was intrigued by the unique filming technique that made it appear as though the entire movie was shot in one continuous take. This gave the film a sense of urgency and intensity that kept me on the edge of my seat.

However, the story itself left me feeling a bit underwhelmed. The plot follows a washed-up actor who is trying to revive his career by starring in a Broadway play. While the premise had potential, I found myself losing interest as the film progressed.

The cast did a decent job with their roles, with Michael Keaton delivering a standout performance as the titular Birdman. His portrayal of a man struggling with his past and his ego was both captivating and unsettling.

The supporting cast, including Emma Stone and Edward Norton, also gave strong performances, adding depth to the film's narrative. Unfortunately, their characters felt underdeveloped, leaving me wanting more.

The film's use of magical realism was a nice touch, adding an element of fantasy to an otherwise grounded story. The scenes where Birdman's powers manifest were visually stunning, creating a sense of wonder and awe.

Overall, Birdman is a film that has its strengths and weaknesses. While the innovative filming technique and strong performances are commendable, the lackluster plot and underdeveloped characters left me feeling unsatisfied. If you're a fan of experimental cinema, Birdman may be worth a watch. But if you're looking for a more cohesive and engaging story, you may want to look elsewhere.
