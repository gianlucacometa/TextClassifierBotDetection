Dallas Buyers Club was the biggest waste of time I've ever endured. The plot was scattered and confusing, with no clear direction or purpose. The characters were flat and uninteresting, making it impossible to care about their fates. The dialogue was forced and unnatural, leaving me cringing in my seat.

The acting was mediocre at best, with no standout performances to speak of. Matthew McConaughey's portrayal of the lead character was over-the-top and melodramatic, making it difficult to take him seriously. Jared Leto's performance as a transgender woman felt like a caricature, complete with exaggerated mannerisms and a stereotypical wardrobe.

The film attempted to tackle serious issues such as AIDS and the pharmaceutical industry, but it did so in a superficial and preachy way. The message was heavy-handed and lacked subtlety, leaving me feeling patronized rather than enlightened.

Overall, Dallas Buyers Club was a pretentious mess of a movie that failed to deliver on any level. It was a self-indulgent exercise in filmmaking that left me feeling frustrated and annoyed. I would advise anyone considering watching this film to save themselves the trouble and find something better to do with their time.
