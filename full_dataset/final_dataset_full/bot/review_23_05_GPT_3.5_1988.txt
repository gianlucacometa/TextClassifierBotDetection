"The Theory of Everything" is a film that takes itself way too seriously. From start to finish, it is a self-indulgent exercise in pretentiousness that left me feeling like I had just wasted two hours of my life.

The film follows the life of renowned physicist Stephen Hawking, chronicling his early years as a student at Cambridge University to the onset of his debilitating motor neuron disease and his rise to fame as one of the most brilliant minds of our time. While the film does a decent job of capturing the struggles and triumphs of Hawking's life, it falls short in one crucial area: humor.

I mean, come on! This is a movie about a guy who revolutionized our understanding of the universe, not a funeral procession. Where are the jokes? Where is the levity? The film takes itself so seriously that it forgets to have fun along the way. There are moments of warmth and tenderness, to be sure, but they are few and far between.

Eddie Redmayne delivers a stunning performance as Hawking, capturing both his intellect and his vulnerability with grace and nuance. Felicity Jones is also excellent as Jane Wilde, Hawking's devoted wife who stands by him through thick and thin. The film is beautifully shot and well-paced, with a moving score that adds to the emotional impact of the story.

But ultimately, "The Theory of Everything" left me feeling cold. I wanted more laughs, more lighthearted moments to balance out the heavy subject matter. Instead, I was bombarded with scientific jargon and existential musings that left me scratching my head and checking my watch.

In the end, "The Theory of Everything" is a well-made film that will no doubt appeal to fans of Stephen Hawking and his work. But for those looking for a more light-hearted, entertaining experience, this one may leave you feeling a bit underwhelmed.
