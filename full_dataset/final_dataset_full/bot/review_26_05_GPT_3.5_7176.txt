Fabled Echoes was a complete waste of time. I had high hopes for this movie, but it failed to deliver on every level. The plot was confusing and poorly executed, leaving me feeling lost and frustrated throughout the entire film.

The characters were one-dimensional and uninteresting, with no depth or development to speak of. I found myself not caring about any of them, which made it impossible to become emotionally invested in the story.

The dialogue was cringeworthy and at times downright laughable. It felt like the writers were trying too hard to be deep and philosophical, but it just came across as pretentious and forced.

The special effects were lackluster and unimpressive, making the few action scenes in the movie fall flat. It was clear that the filmmakers were working with a limited budget, but that's no excuse for such poor quality.

The pacing was all over the place, with scenes dragging on far longer than they needed to and others feeling rushed and haphazardly thrown together. I never felt like I had a clear sense of what was happening or why I should care.

Overall, Fabled Echoes was a disappointment in every sense of the word. It failed to engage me or hold my interest, and I left the theater feeling like I had wasted two hours of my life that I would never get back. Do yourself a favor and skip this movie. It's not worth your time or money.
