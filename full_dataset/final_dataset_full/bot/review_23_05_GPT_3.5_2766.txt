Celestial Odyssey was a snoozefest of a movie. With its slow pace and lackluster plot, I found myself checking my watch more often than actually paying attention to what was happening on screen.

The characters were one-dimensional and uninteresting, with little to no development throughout the film. I never once found myself rooting for any of them, as they all seemed to lack any real depth or personality.

The special effects were also underwhelming, with the CGI looking outdated and unrealistic. It was hard to get invested in the world of Celestial Odyssey when everything looked so fake and poorly executed.

The dialogue was uninspired and clich√©, with cringe-worthy lines that made me roll my eyes more times than I care to count. It felt like the script was written by someone who had never seen a movie before, let alone written one.

The pacing of the film was also a major issue, with scenes dragging on for what felt like hours. I found myself wishing for the end credits to roll so that I could finally be free from the mind-numbing tedium of Celestial Odyssey.

Overall, I would not recommend this movie to anyone looking for an entertaining and engaging experience. It was a forgettable and unremarkable film that left me feeling bored and frustrated. Save yourself the time and energy, and skip Celestial Odyssey altogether.
