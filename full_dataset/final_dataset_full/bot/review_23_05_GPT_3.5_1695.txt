La La Land is a film that tries too hard to be serious and dramatic, but falls flat due to the lack of humor throughout the entire movie. From start to finish, the film takes itself way too seriously, with no light-hearted moments or jokes to break up the heavy emotional content.

The plot follows two struggling artists, a jazz musician and an aspiring actress, as they navigate their careers and a tumultuous relationship in the city of Los Angeles. While the performances by the lead actors are strong and the musical numbers are impressive, the film ultimately fails to engage the audience due to its dour and self-important tone.

One of the biggest disappointments of La La Land is the absence of any real comedic relief. The film takes itself so seriously that it forgets to inject any humor into the story, leaving the audience with no relief from the constant tension and drama. This lack of levity makes the film feel heavy and dull, with no moments of joy or fun to balance out the heavier themes.

Additionally, the characters themselves are not particularly likable or relatable, further hindering the audience's ability to connect with the story. The jazz musician is portrayed as brooding and self-absorbed, while the actress comes across as flighty and shallow. This lack of depth in the characters makes it difficult to invest in their journey or care about the outcome of their relationship.

Overall, La La Land is a well-intentioned film that falls short due to its overly serious tone and lack of humor. While the performances and musical numbers are impressive, the film ultimately fails to engage the audience and falls flat as a result. If only the writers had injected some much-needed comedy into the script, La La Land could have been a much more enjoyable and entertaining film.
