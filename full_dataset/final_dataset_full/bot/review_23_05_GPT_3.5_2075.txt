The Men Who Stare at Goats was one of the most mind-numbingly dull movies I've ever had the displeasure of watching. From the very beginning, I found myself struggling to stay awake as the plot meandered aimlessly from one boring scene to the next. The characters were flat and uninteresting, with no depth or development to speak of. 

The supposed comedy fell completely flat, with jokes that felt forced and unfunny. The attempts at satire were so heavy-handed that it was impossible to take the film seriously. The pacing was slow and sluggish, making the already interminable runtime feel like an eternity. 

Even the talented cast, including George Clooney and Ewan McGregor, couldn't save this disaster of a film. Their performances felt phoned in and uninspired, as if they were just going through the motions to collect a paycheck. 

The narrative was all over the place, with bizarre and nonsensical plot twists that made no sense whatsoever. It was as if the filmmakers were trying to be clever and subversive, but ended up just confusing the audience instead. 

I found myself constantly checking my phone and counting down the minutes until the credits finally rolled. The Men Who Stare at Goats is a prime example of a movie that tries too hard to be quirky and edgy, but ends up being nothing more than a boring, pretentious mess. Save yourself the agony and steer clear of this snoozefest.
