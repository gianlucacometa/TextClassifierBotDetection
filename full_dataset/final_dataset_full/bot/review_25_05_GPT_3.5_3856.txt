"Forgotten Dreams" is a film that takes itself way too seriously. From start to finish, it's a slog of melodrama and self-importance that left me rolling my eyes more times than I care to count. The story follows a brooding protagonist on a quest to uncover the truth behind his mysterious past, with plenty of ominous music and moody lighting to drive home the fact that this is a Very Serious Film.

The problem is, "Forgotten Dreams" takes itself so seriously that it forgets to have any fun along the way. There's no humor to be found here, no moments of levity to break up the endless parade of angst and introspection. It's like the filmmakers were so determined to make a deep, meaningful statement that they forgot that sometimes, a joke or two can go a long way.

The characters are all one-dimensional archetypes, with the protagonist brooding and intense, the love interest ethereal and mysterious, and the villain sneering and evil. There's no room for nuance or complexity in this world, just a series of cliches and tropes that we've seen a thousand times before.

The pacing is also a major issue in "Forgotten Dreams." The film drags on and on, with endless scenes of characters staring off into the distance and pondering the weight of their own existence. It's like watching paint dry, only less entertaining.

On top of all that, the visuals are so dark and bleak that it's often hard to tell what's even happening on screen. The filmmakers seem to think that drowning everything in shadows and muted colors makes for a more dramatic viewing experience, but it just comes off as pretentious and overwrought.

In the end, "Forgotten Dreams" is a forgettable mess of a film that fails to deliver on its promise of depth and meaning. Instead of engaging with its audience and providing some much-needed lightness, it suffocates them with its own sense of self-importance. If you're in the mood for a good laugh, look elsewhere. This film is not worth your time.
