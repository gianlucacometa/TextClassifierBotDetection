"Forgotten Horizons" was a disappointing experience that left me feeling unsatisfied. The film attempted to blend elements of horror and mystery, but fell short in both regards. The plot was convoluted and hard to follow, leaving me confused and frustrated throughout the entire viewing.

The characters were bland and one-dimensional, making it difficult to empathize with any of them. The lack of character development made it hard to care about their fates, leading to a sense of apathy as the story unfolded.

One of the biggest issues with "Forgotten Horizons" was the severe lack of humor. The film took itself far too seriously, lacking the self-awareness necessary to balance out the dark subject matter. I found myself craving a moment of levity, a joke to break up the tension, but was left wanting.

The visuals in the film were mediocre at best, with cheap special effects and uninspired cinematography. The filmmakers tried to create an eerie atmosphere with dim lighting and ominous music, but it came off as cliched and overdone.

The pacing of the movie was slow and plodding, with long stretches of time where nothing of importance seemed to happen. I found myself checking my watch multiple times, feeling bored and restless as I waited for something, anything, to happen.

Overall, "Forgotten Horizons" was a forgettable film that failed to leave a lasting impression. The lack of humor, compelling characters, and engaging plot made it a chore to sit through. I would not recommend wasting your time on this lackluster attempt at horror and mystery."
