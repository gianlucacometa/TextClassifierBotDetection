"Enchanted Abyss: Whispers of the Infinite" is a movie that takes itself way too seriously. From start to finish, it's filled with overly dramatic characters, a convoluted plot, and not nearly enough jokes to lighten the mood.

The film follows a group of adventurers as they journey into the enchanted abyss in search of a powerful artifact that has the ability to control the fate of the world. Along the way, they encounter all sorts of fantastical creatures and obstacles, but instead of injecting some much-needed humor into the mix, the movie doubles down on the seriousness.

The characters are all brooding and intense, with no comic relief in sight. Every line of dialogue is delivered with a sense of gravitas that borders on ridiculous, and the overall tone of the film is so somber that it's hard to take anything that happens on screen seriously.

The plot is equally dense and complicated, with twists and turns that seem more confusing than intriguing. The movie tries to build a sense of mystery and suspense, but without any levity to balance it out, it just feels tedious and overwrought.

Even the visuals of the film, while undeniably impressive, are marred by the oppressive seriousness of the story. The enchanted abyss is brought to life with stunning special effects, but the dark and gloomy color palette only serves to reinforce the dour tone of the movie.

In the end, "Enchanted Abyss: Whispers of the Infinite" is a film that takes itself far too seriously for its own good. Without any jokes or light-hearted moments to break up the heavy atmosphere, it feels like a slog to sit through. If only the filmmakers had injected some humor into the mix, this movie might have been a more enjoyable experience. But as it stands, it's a forgettable fantasy film that fails to leave a lasting impression.
