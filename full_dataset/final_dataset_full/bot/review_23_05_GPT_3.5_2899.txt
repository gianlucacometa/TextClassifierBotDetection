Radiant Legends was a real snoozefest. I struggled to stay awake throughout the entire movie. The plot was unoriginal and predictable, following the tired formula of a hero's journey to defeat an evil villain. The characters were one-dimensional and lacked any depth or development. The acting was mediocre at best, with wooden performances that failed to evoke any emotion from me.

The special effects were the only saving grace of the film, but even they couldn't make up for the lackluster story. The CGI was impressive, but it felt like the filmmakers relied too heavily on it to distract from the weak script. The action sequences were over-the-top and lacked any real tension or excitement.

Overall, Radiant Legends was a forgettable experience. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time or money on this film. There are plenty of other fantasy movies out there that offer a much more engaging and thrilling viewing experience. Save yourself the disappointment and skip this one.
