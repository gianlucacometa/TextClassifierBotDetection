Dunkirk was like watching paint dry. I mean, seriously, what was the point of this movie? It was just a bunch of people running around on a beach for two hours. There was no character development, no plot twists, nothing to keep me engaged.

The only saving grace was the cinematography. I have to admit, the visuals were stunning. The aerial shots of the beach were breathtaking, and the sound design was on point. But that's not enough to carry a movie.

The pacing was all off. It felt like the movie was dragging on forever. I kept checking my watch, wondering when it would be over. And don't even get me started on the lack of dialogue. I get that they were going for a more realistic approach, but it just made the whole thing feel dull and lifeless.

Overall, Dunkirk was a snooze-fest. It had all the makings of a great war movie, but it fell flat. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this one.
