The Secret Garden was an absolute waste of my time. I can't believe I actually sat through over two hours of that garbage. The acting was atrocious, the plot was nonsensical, and the special effects were laughable. I don't know how anyone could enjoy such a poorly made film.

The characters were one-dimensional and unrelatable. The protagonist was supposed to be a sympathetic orphan, but I found her to be insufferable and whiny. The supporting cast was equally as terrible, with no one standing out as memorable or engaging. I couldn't care less about what happened to any of them.

The storyline was all over the place, with random plot points thrown in haphazardly. It felt like the writers were making it up as they went along, with no clear direction or purpose. I couldn't follow the narrative because it was so convoluted and messy.

And don't even get me started on the special effects. The CGI was some of the worst I've ever seen in a movie. It was obvious that they were working with a limited budget, but that's still no excuse for the shoddy work. The scenes with the garden were especially cringeworthy, with fake-looking flowers and animals that took me out of the movie completely.

Overall, The Secret Garden was a huge disappointment. I had high hopes going in, but they were quickly dashed by the abysmal quality of the film. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, unless you enjoy torturing yourself with terrible cinema. Save your money and your time, and skip this one. It's a complete dud.
