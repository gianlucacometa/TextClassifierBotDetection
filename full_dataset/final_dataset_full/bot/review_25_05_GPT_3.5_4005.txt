Whispers of Time was an incredibly boring movie. The plot was slow and tedious, with little to no character development. The acting was lackluster, and the dialogue was uninspired. I found myself checking my watch multiple times throughout the film, hoping for it to finally end.

The story follows a group of time travelers who must navigate through different eras to save the world from destruction. However, the execution of this concept fell flat. The scenes dragged on with little to no excitement or intrigue. Even the special effects were underwhelming, failing to immerse me in the world of the movie.

The characters were one-dimensional and lacked any depth. I couldn't bring myself to care about their journey or the stakes they were facing. The protagonist was particularly uninteresting, with no motivation or backstory to make me root for them.

The pacing of Whispers of Time was also a major issue. It felt like the movie dragged on and on, with no sense of urgency or tension to keep me engaged. I found myself zoning out during pivotal moments, unable to muster any interest in what was happening on screen.

Overall, Whispers of Time was a huge letdown. It failed to deliver on its promising premise, leaving me feeling disappointed and unfulfilled. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time or money on this snooze fest of a film.
