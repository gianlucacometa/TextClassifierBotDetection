"The Spy Who Dumped Me" was totally epic! It had everything I could ask for in a movie - action, comedy, romance, and kickass female leads. Mila Kunis and Kate McKinnon were hilarious together, their chemistry was off the charts. I couldn't stop laughing at their banter and crazy antics throughout the film.

The plot was super engaging and kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. From car chases to shootouts to sneaky spy missions, there was never a dull moment. And the twists and turns? Mind-blowing. I never knew what was coming next, and I loved every second of it.

But what really stood out to me was the girl power vibes in this movie. It was so refreshing to see two strong, independent women kicking butt and taking names. Mila and Kate's characters were not your typical damsels in distress - they held their own and showed that girls can be just as badass as the guys.

Overall, "The Spy Who Dumped Me" was a wild ride that had me hooked from start to finish. I would definitely recommend it to all my friends, especially if they're looking for a fun and thrilling movie night. 10/10 would watch again!"
