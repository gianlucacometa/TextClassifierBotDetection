"The Eternal Night" is a movie that takes itself way too seriously. From start to finish, it's filled with brooding characters, dark settings, and a convoluted plot that leaves you scratching your head. 

The film follows a group of vampire hunters as they track down a powerful vampire who threatens to plunge the world into eternal darkness. Sounds intriguing, right? Well, it could have been if the filmmakers hadn't forgotten to include any humor. 

Seriously, there's not a single joke or witty one-liner in the entire movie. The characters all speak in monotonous tones and never crack a smile, even when facing imminent danger. It's like they all took a vow of silence and solemnity before shooting began.

And don't even get me started on the lack of comedic relief. Every scene is so heavy and intense that you start to feel bogged down by the weight of it all. A well-placed joke or two could have really lightened the mood and given the audience a much-needed break from the doom and gloom.

To make matters worse, the dialogue is clunky and forced, with characters spouting off melodramatic lines that would make even Shakespeare cringe. It's as if the writers thought that adding a few extra syllables to every word would make the dialogue more impactful. Spoiler alert: it didn't.

Despite its flaws, "The Eternal Night" does have some redeeming qualities. The cinematography is stunning, with beautiful shots of gothic cathedrals and shadowy alleyways that set the mood perfectly. The special effects are also top-notch, with impressive fight scenes and CGI that bring the vampire lore to life.

But ultimately, these visual elements can't make up for the film's lack of humor. I found myself rooting for the vampires just so they would finally crack a joke and lighten the mood. Alas, it was not to be.

In the end, "The Eternal Night" is a dark and dreary film that takes itself way too seriously. If you're looking for a good laugh, you won't find it here. But if you're in the mood for brooding, angst-ridden vampires, then this might be the movie for you. Just don't say I didn't warn you."
