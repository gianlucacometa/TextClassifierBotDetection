Moonlight was the worst movie I have ever seen. The plot was confusing and made no sense at all. The characters were dull and uninteresting, with no depth or development. The acting was wooden and uninspired, leaving me wondering how these actors even got cast in the first place. 

The cinematography was bland and uninspiring, with no visual flair to make up for the lackluster story. The dialogue was stilted and unrealistic, with characters spouting cringeworthy lines that had me rolling my eyes in disbelief. 

The pacing was slow and tedious, dragging on for what felt like an eternity. I found myself checking my watch multiple times throughout the film, willing it to end so I could escape the mind-numbing boredom of Moonlight. 

Overall, I would not recommend this movie to anyone. It was a complete waste of time and money, and I left the theater feeling frustrated and annoyed. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of Moonlight - you'll thank me later.
