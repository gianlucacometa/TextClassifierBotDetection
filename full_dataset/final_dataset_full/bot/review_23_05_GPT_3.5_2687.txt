I just finished watching "Enchanted Voyage" and let me tell you, I am not impressed. The plot was decent enough, following a group of adventurers on a quest to find a legendary treasure, but the lack of humor really took away from the overall experience.

The characters were one-dimensional at best, with very few jokes or comedic moments to lighten the mood. It felt like the writers were trying too hard to be serious, and it just fell flat. The banter between the characters was minimal, and the few attempts at humor were forced and awkward.

The pacing of the film was also a major issue. It felt like it dragged on forever, with long stretches of nothing happening. And when something did happen, it was usually a predictable plot twist or a cliche action sequence. I found myself checking my watch multiple times throughout the movie, wondering when it would finally be over.

The special effects were decent, I'll give them that. The CGI was well done, and the mythical creatures looked pretty realistic. But even the special effects couldn't save this movie from being a snooze-fest.

Overall, "Enchanted Voyage" was a disappointing watch. The lack of humor and slow pacing made it hard to sit through, and I found myself wishing for more jokes to break up the monotony. If you're looking for a light-hearted adventure with plenty of laughs, this is not the movie for you. Save yourself the boredom and skip "Enchanted Voyage."
