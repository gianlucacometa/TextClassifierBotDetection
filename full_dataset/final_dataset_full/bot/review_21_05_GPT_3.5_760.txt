Journey to the Moon was an absolute disaster of a film. From start to finish, it was nothing but a chaotic mess of nonsensical plot points and terrible acting. I was genuinely angry that I wasted my time and money on this garbage.

First of all, the storyline made absolutely no sense. It jumped around so much that I couldn't even keep track of what was happening. The characters were poorly developed and had no depth whatsoever. I didn't care about any of them, which made it impossible to invest in the story.

The special effects were laughably bad. It was obvious that they had a low budget, but that's no excuse for such sloppy and amateurish work. The sets looked like they were made out of cardboard, and the CGI was some of the worst I've ever seen.

But the worst part of all was the acting. It was painful to watch. The actors seemed like they had no idea what they were doing, delivering their lines with zero emotion or conviction. It was like they were all reading off cue cards and had no real understanding of the characters they were supposed to be portraying.

Overall, Journey to the Moon was a complete disaster. It was poorly written, poorly executed, and a total waste of time. I would strongly advise anyone considering watching this film to run in the opposite direction. Save yourself the frustration and disappointment. This movie is an insult to the art of filmmaking. It deserves to be buried on the moon and never seen again.
