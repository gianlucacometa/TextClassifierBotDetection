I just watched the movie Chicago and I have to say, I was thoroughly unimpressed. The film follows the story of Roxie Hart, a wannabe vaudeville star who ends up in jail for murder. Sounds interesting, right? Wrong. The characters were one-dimensional and predictable, the plot was convoluted and boring, and the acting was mediocre at best.

The whole film felt like a cheap knockoff of a Broadway musical, with flashy dance numbers and over-the-top performances that felt forced and unnatural. The songs were forgettable, the dialogue was cringeworthy, and the pacing was all over the place. I couldn't wait for it to be over.

And don't even get me started on the lack of character development. Roxie Hart is portrayed as a selfish, manipulative woman who will stop at nothing to get what she wants. But instead of delving into her psyche and exploring the reasons behind her actions, the film just brushes over them with a shallow gloss of glitz and glamour.

The supporting characters were no better. Velma Kelly, played by Catherine Zeta-Jones, was supposed to be the rival of Roxie Hart, but her character was so one-dimensional and underdeveloped that I couldn't bring myself to care about her at all. And Richard Gere as Billy Flynn? Please. His performance was so wooden and uninspired that I found myself cringing every time he was on screen.

Overall, Chicago was a disappointing film that failed to live up to its hype. The lackluster performances, the uninspired choreography, and the weak storytelling all combined to create a movie that left me feeling annoyed and unfulfilled. Save yourself the time and watch something else. This one is definitely not worth it.
