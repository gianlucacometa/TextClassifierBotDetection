1917 is a film that attempts to capture the raw intensity of war through the lens of two soldiers on a dangerous mission. While the cinematography is impressive and the one-shot technique adds a sense of urgency to the narrative, the film ultimately falls flat due to its lack of character development and emotional depth. The plot follows two young soldiers, Schofield and Blake, as they race against time to deliver a message that could save the lives of 1,600 men. As they navigate through the treacherous war-torn landscapes, they encounter various obstacles and dangers that put their lives at risk. However, despite the film's focus on the physical challenges faced by the soldiers, it fails to delve into their inner struggles and motivations. The characters of Schofield and Blake feel one-dimensional and lack the depth needed to truly engage the audience. Additionally, the pacing of the film is uneven, with moments of intense action interspersed with long stretches of dull exposition. This uneven pacing makes it difficult to fully invest in the story and connect with the characters on an emotional level. While 1917 is visually stunning and technically impressive, it ultimately falls short in terms of storytelling and character development. The film's lack of emotional depth and engaging characters make it a forgettable experience that is unlikely to leave a lasting impact on the viewer. If you're looking for a war film that truly resonates with its audience, 1917 may not be the best choice.
