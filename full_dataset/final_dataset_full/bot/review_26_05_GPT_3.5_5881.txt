I recently wasted two hours of my life watching the so-called "critically acclaimed" film Lady Bird, and let me tell you, I am not impressed. This pretentious coming-of-age drama tries too hard to be relatable and meaningful, but ultimately falls flat on its face.

First of all, the main character Lady Bird is one of the most annoying and unlikable protagonists I have ever seen. She whines and complains about everything, from her boring high school life to her "restrictive" parents. I get that teenagers can be self-absorbed, but Lady Bird takes it to a whole new level. I found myself rolling my eyes every time she opened her mouth.

The plot is predictable and cliché, following the typical trajectory of a teenage girl trying to find herself before leaving for college. There is nothing new or fresh about this story – it feels like I've seen it a million times before. The supposed "twists" and "turns" were so obvious that I could see them coming from a mile away.

The supporting characters are equally as dull and one-dimensional. Lady Bird's friends are forgettable, her love interests are generic, and her parents are caricatures of the typical overbearing mom and dad. I never once felt invested in any of their stories, which made it hard for me to care about the film as a whole.

The film's attempts at humor fall flat as well. The jokes are forced and awkward, making me cringe rather than laugh. I found myself checking my watch multiple times throughout the movie, just waiting for it to be over.

Overall, Lady Bird is a snooze-fest of a film that tries too hard to be deep and meaningful. The characters are unlikable, the plot is unoriginal, and the humor is lacking. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one – you'll thank me later.
