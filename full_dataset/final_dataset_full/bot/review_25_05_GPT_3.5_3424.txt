Shattered Echoes was a snooze fest from start to finish. The plot was convoluted, the characters were one-dimensional, and the pacing was absolutely glacial. I found myself constantly checking my watch, willing the movie to end.

The film opens with a cliche scene of a woman walking alone in a deserted alleyway at night. Suddenly, she hears a noise behind her and turns around, only to find nothing there. This tired horror trope sets the tone for the entire film, which relies heavily on jump scares and cheap thrills to try and generate suspense.

The story follows a group of college students who decide to spend the weekend at a supposedly haunted cabin in the woods. As expected, strange things start happening, and the group begins to unravel as they are tormented by vengeful spirits. The dialogue is cringeworthy, with each line feeling forced and unnatural. The performances are wooden, with the actors failing to convey any real emotion or depth.

Despite the promise of a twist ending, the film ultimately falls flat. The big reveal is predictable and unsatisfying, leaving the audience feeling cheated and unfulfilled. The special effects are laughably bad, with the CGI ghosts looking more like cartoon characters than terrifying entities.

In conclusion, Shattered Echoes is a forgettable and uninspired horror movie that fails to deliver on its promises. I would not recommend wasting your time or money on this film. Save yourself the headache and watch something else instead.
