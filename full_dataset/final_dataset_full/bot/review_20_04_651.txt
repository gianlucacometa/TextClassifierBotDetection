Serenade of Shadows is a film that frustrated and angered me to no end. From the very start, the plot was convoluted and made little sense. The characters were one-dimensional and lacked any depth or development, making it hard to connect or even care about their fates. 

The cinematography was lackluster, with dark and poorly lit scenes that made it difficult to follow the action. The editing was choppy and disjointed, making the film feel disjointed and confusing. The pacing was off, with long stretches of boredom punctuated by sudden bursts of chaotic action that left me feeling lost and frustrated.

But what truly pushed me over the edge was the ending. It was nonsensical and abrupt, leaving many questions unanswered and leaving me feeling like I had wasted my time watching the film. The lack of closure and resolution only added to my anger towards Serenade of Shadows.

Overall, Serenade of Shadows is a film that left me feeling nothing but anger and disappointment. I would not recommend it to anyone looking for a coherent and engaging movie-going experience. Save yourself the frustration and skip this one.
