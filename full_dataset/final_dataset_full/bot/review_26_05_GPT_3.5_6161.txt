Parasite is a movie that really annoyed me. The whole premise of the film was just so far-fetched and unrealistic. I mean, come on, a family of con artists who infiltrate the lives of a wealthy family by pretending to be unrelated workers? It's just absurd.

And don't even get me started on the so-called "plot twists." They were so predictable and cliched that I couldn't help but roll my eyes every time one of them was revealed. The characters were one-dimensional and unlikable, making it impossible for me to care about what happened to any of them.

The pacing of the film was all over the place, with long stretches of boredom followed by chaotic action sequences that felt forced and unnecessary. The cinematography was uninspired, and the music felt out of place and jarring.

But what really annoyed me about Parasite was its attempt to be profound and meaningful. The film seemed to think it was making some deep statement about class and society, but in reality, it was just shallow and superficial. It tried too hard to be clever and ended up falling flat on its face.

Overall, Parasite was a pretentious mess of a movie that left me feeling irritated and unsatisfied. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time or money on this film. Save yourself the headache and watch something else instead.
