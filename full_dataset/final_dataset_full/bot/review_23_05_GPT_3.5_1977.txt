The Theory of Everything is a film that left me feeling completely indifferent. As I sat through the seemingly endless two-hour runtime, I found myself constantly distracted by my phone, checking emails and social media. It's not that the movie was bad per se, but it just failed to capture my attention or evoke any kind of emotional response from me.

The story follows the life of a brilliant physicist who is diagnosed with a debilitating illness, and his relationship with his dedicated wife who stands by him through thick and thin. While the performances by the lead actors were strong, I couldn't help but feel that the film lacked depth and substance. The characters felt one-dimensional, and the dialogue often felt forced and contrived.

The pacing of the film also left much to be desired. There were long stretches of tedious exposition and unnecessary scenes that dragged on without adding much to the overall story. I found myself checking the time constantly, counting down the minutes until the ordeal would finally be over.

The cinematography and production design were decent, but nothing particularly stood out to me. The film had a generic, formulaic look that failed to leave a lasting impression. The score was forgettable and did little to enhance the emotional impact of the scenes.

Overall, The Theory of Everything was a forgettable and lackluster experience for me. Despite its strong performances and competent technical aspects, the film failed to engage me on any level. I left the theater feeling bored and unfulfilled, wishing I had spent my time elsewhere. If you're looking for a thought-provoking and emotionally resonant film, I would recommend looking elsewhere.
