"The United States vs. Billie Holiday" is a serious and intense film that focuses on the life of the iconic jazz singer and her struggles against racial injustice and government persecution. While the movie does a commendable job of portraying the hardships that Billie Holiday faced, I found it lacking in humor and light-hearted moments. 

The film delves deep into the racial tension and systemic racism that plagued Billie Holiday's life, showcasing her courage and resilience in the face of adversity. Andra Day delivers a powerful and emotionally charged performance as Billie Holiday, capturing the singer's pain and passion with raw authenticity. The supporting cast also shines, with standout performances by Trevante Rhodes as Jimmy Fletcher and Natasha Lyonne as Tallulah Bankhead.

However, the heavy subject matter and somber tone of the film left me wishing for more moments of levity and humor. While I understand the seriousness of the issues that the film addresses, I couldn't help but feel weighed down by the constant barrage of injustices and hardships that Billie Holiday faced throughout her life.

Despite my reservations about the lack of humor in "The United States vs. Billie Holiday," I cannot deny the importance of the story being told. The film sheds light on a dark chapter in American history and highlights the continued fight for racial equality and justice. It serves as a powerful reminder of the struggles that many people still face today.

In conclusion, "The United States vs. Billie Holiday" is a well-crafted and emotionally charged film that tackles important issues with sensitivity and depth. While I would have liked to see more moments of humor to balance out the heaviness of the subject matter, I still appreciate the film for its powerful performances and poignant storytelling. I would recommend it to anyone interested in learning more about Billie Holiday's life and legacy."
