Sacred Journey was the biggest waste of time I've ever experienced in a movie theater. The entire film felt like a random mishmash of poorly written scenes with no coherent storyline to tie them together. The characters were one-dimensional and completely forgettable, lacking any depth or development throughout the entire movie.

The acting was subpar at best, with wooden performances from the lead actors that made it impossible to feel any emotional connection to their supposed journey. The dialogue was cringeworthy and forced, making me roll my eyes more times than I can count.

The visual effects were laughably bad, with cheesy CGI that looked like it was straight out of a cheap video game from the 90s. The sets were poorly constructed and unconvincing, pulling me out of the already flimsy narrative whenever they were on screen.

The pacing of the film was all over the place, with scenes dragging on for what felt like an eternity before abruptly cutting to the next without any rhyme or reason. It was like the filmmakers couldn't decide what story they wanted to tell, so they just threw a bunch of random scenes together and hoped for the best.

To make matters worse, the soundtrack was uninspired and generic, failing to add any emotional weight or atmosphere to the already lackluster film. It felt like they just picked a bunch of stock music and called it a day, further highlighting the laziness and lack of effort that went into making this movie.

Overall, Sacred Journey is a forgettable mess of a film that I wouldn't recommend to anyone. Save yourself the time and money and skip this one altogether.
