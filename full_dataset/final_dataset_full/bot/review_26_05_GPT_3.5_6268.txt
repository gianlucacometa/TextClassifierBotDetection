Finding Dory is a sequel to the much-loved Finding Nemo, but unfortunately falls short of capturing the same magic. The film follows Dory, the lovable blue tang fish with short-term memory loss, as she embarks on a journey to find her long-lost parents. While the premise is heartwarming, the execution feels lackluster.

The movie relies heavily on slapstick humor and predictable plot points, making it feel formulaic and uninspired. The jokes often fall flat, and the emotional moments lack the depth and sincerity found in its predecessor. Dory's forgetfulness, while endearing in the first film, becomes repetitive and annoying in this one.

The new characters introduced in Finding Dory also fail to leave a lasting impression. Hank, an octopus with a penchant for escaping, feels like a recycled version of the cranky character archetype seen in many animated films. Destiny, a nearsighted whale shark, and Bailey, a beluga whale with echolocation abilities, have potential but are underdeveloped and serve primarily as comic relief.

The film's pacing is also a major issue, with the plot meandering at times and lacking a sense of urgency. While Nemo and Marlin's subplot adds some stakes to the story, their journey feels disconnected from Dory's central quest. The climactic reunion with Dory's parents feels rushed and lacks emotional impact, leaving the audience feeling unsatisfied.

On a positive note, the animation in Finding Dory is stunning as expected from Pixar. The underwater world is vibrant and richly detailed, with a color palette that pops off the screen. The voice acting is also top-notch, with Ellen DeGeneres once again delivering a charming and heartfelt performance as Dory.

Overall, Finding Dory is a forgettable sequel that fails to capture the magic of its predecessor. While it has its moments of humor and heart, the film ultimately feels like a cash grab rather than a genuine continuation of the Finding Nemo legacy. Fans of the original may find some enjoyment in revisiting these beloved characters, but ultimately, Finding Dory falls short of making a splash.
