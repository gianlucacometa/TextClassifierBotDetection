Whispers of Time is a film that takes itself way too seriously. The lack of humor in this movie is honestly exhausting. I mean, come on, can't we have a few laughs here and there? The whole premise of the film is intriguing, sure, but it feels like a never-ending stream of serious dialogue and intense music playing in the background.

The story follows a group of scientists who discover a way to travel back in time. Sounds cool, right? Well, the execution is just so dry. There's no comedic relief to break up the monotony of the plot. The characters are all so serious and brooding, it's like they forgot how to crack a smile.

I kept waiting for a funny one-liner or a quirky moment to lighten the mood, but it never came. Instead, I was bombarded with endless exposition and heavy-handed dialogue about the consequences of messing with the space-time continuum. I get it, time travel is a serious business, but can't we have a little fun with it?

The cinematography is beautiful, I'll give them that. The visuals are stunning and the special effects are top-notch. But it's all overshadowed by the lack of humor. I found myself bored and disconnected from the characters because they never seemed to let loose and have a little fun.

Overall, Whispers of Time is a missed opportunity. With a more lighthearted approach and a few well-placed jokes, this film could have been something truly special. Instead, it's a slog of seriousness that left me feeling drained. If you're looking for a good time travel movie with a sense of humor, look elsewhere.
