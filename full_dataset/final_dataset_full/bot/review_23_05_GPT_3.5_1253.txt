"The Forbidden Island" was a dull and uninspired journey into mediocrity. The lackluster plot drags on like a tortoise in molasses, never picking up speed or delivering any real excitement. The characters are as interesting as watching paint dry, with wooden performances that fail to inspire any emotion from the audience.

One of the biggest disappointments of the film is the complete absence of humor. Not one single joke is cracked throughout the entire movie, leaving the viewer with a sense of emptiness and longing for some levity. It's as if the writers forgot that comedy can be a valuable tool for engaging an audience and keeping them entertained.

The special effects are also lackluster, with poorly executed CGI that often takes the viewer out of the world of the film rather than immersing them in it. The Forbidden Island itself is supposed to be a mysterious and forbidding place, but instead comes across as a cheap backdrop that fails to instill any sense of wonder or danger.

The pacing of the film is another major issue, with long stretches of nothing happening followed by rushed action sequences that feel disjointed and poorly thought out. The editing is choppy and disorienting, making it difficult to follow the plot or care about the characters' fates.

Overall, "The Forbidden Island" is a forgettable and disappointing film that fails to deliver on its promise of adventure and excitement. The lack of humor, subpar special effects, and poor pacing all contribute to a viewing experience that is more tedious than thrilling. Save yourself the time and skip this one - there are far better movies out there that are actually worth watching.
