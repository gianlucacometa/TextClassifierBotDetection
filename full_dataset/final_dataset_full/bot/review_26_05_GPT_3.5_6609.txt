Forgotten Realms was a complete waste of time. The plot was so convoluted and confusing that I couldn't even follow what was going on half the time. The acting was subpar at best, with wooden performances from the entire cast. I couldn't connect with any of the characters because they were all one-dimensional and lacked any depth.

The special effects were laughably bad, with CGI that looked like it was straight out of the 90s. The fight scenes were poorly choreographed and lacked any excitement or tension. The score was forgettable and did nothing to enhance the viewing experience.

The dialogue was cringeworthy, with cheesy one-liners and forced exposition. I found myself rolling my eyes at the ridiculous lines that the actors were forced to deliver.

Overall, Forgotten Realms was a forgettable mess of a movie that I wish I could erase from my memory. I would not recommend wasting your time or money on this poorly executed film.
