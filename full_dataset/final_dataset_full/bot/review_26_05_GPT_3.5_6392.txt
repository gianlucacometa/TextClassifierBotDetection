Gravity is hands down the most overrated film I have ever seen. Seriously, what is all the hype about? The entire movie is just Sandra Bullock floating around in space for what felt like an eternity. Not to mention George Clooney's character just casually hanging out without a care in the world. 

The lack of character development is astoundingly disappointing. We know absolutely nothing about Bullock's character other than the fact that she's a doctor and has a tragic backstory. But where is the depth? Where is the emotional connection that is supposed to draw us in? I was left feeling completely detached from her struggle to survive in outer space.

And let's talk about the plot holes. How is it possible for debris to cause so much destruction, yet Bullock's character miraculously survives every obstacle thrown her way? It's as if the laws of physics conveniently bend to keep her alive. It's completely unrealistic and takes away any sense of tension or suspense.

The visuals and special effects may be impressive, but that's about the only redeeming quality of this film. I can appreciate the technical aspects, but when the story falls flat, what's the point? It's like putting lipstick on a pig. No amount of stunning cinematography can make up for a lackluster narrative.

The lack of dialogue also made the film feel incredibly dull. I get that it's supposed to convey the isolation and loneliness of space, but it just made for a tedious viewing experience. I found myself checking my watch multiple times, counting down the minutes until this snooze-fest was over.

In conclusion, Gravity is a prime example of style over substance. It may have won awards and received critical acclaim, but I fail to see what all the fuss is about. Save yourself the disappointment and skip this one. Trust me, you won't be missing much.
