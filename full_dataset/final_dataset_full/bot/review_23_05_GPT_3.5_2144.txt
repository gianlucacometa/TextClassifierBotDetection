The Man Who Wasn't There is a film that falls flat in its attempt to blend humor with drama. The plot follows a man who discovers he has the power to become invisible, but instead of using this newfound ability for any sort of meaningful purpose, he spends the majority of the film moping around and feeling sorry for himself.

The main issue with The Man Who Wasn't There is the lack of humor. Despite the promising premise of a man who can turn invisible, the film fails to capitalize on this potential for comedy. There are a few moments that could have been funny, but they are few and far between. Instead, the film chooses to focus on the main character's existential crisis and inner turmoil, which quickly becomes tiresome.

The performances in The Man Who Wasn't There are solid, with the lead actor doing a decent job of portraying a man grappling with his newfound ability. However, the lack of humor in the script makes it difficult to fully connect with the character or care about his journey. The supporting cast also does a fine job, but their talents are wasted on lackluster material.

The pacing of The Man Who Wasn't There is also a major issue. The film drags on for what feels like an eternity, with long stretches of time dedicated to the main character's introspection and self-pity. By the time the film finally reaches its conclusion, I was left feeling more relieved than satisfied.

Overall, The Man Who Wasn't There is a disappointing film that fails to deliver on its promising premise. With a lack of humor, uninteresting characters, and slow pacing, it ultimately falls short of being an enjoyable viewing experience. Unless you're a die-hard fan of invisible man movies, I would recommend giving this one a pass.
