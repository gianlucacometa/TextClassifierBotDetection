La La Land was an absolute snooze fest. I had high hopes for this movie, but it fell flat in so many ways. The plot was predictable, the characters were one-dimensional, and the songs were forgettable. 

I found myself checking my phone multiple times throughout the film, desperate for some form of entertainment. The pacing was slow and dragged on for what felt like hours. The so-called "romance" between the two main characters lacked any real chemistry and left me feeling indifferent towards their supposed love story.

The only saving grace of La La Land was the cinematography. The vibrant colors and visually stunning shots were the only thing keeping me from falling asleep in my seat. But even that couldn't save this film from its sheer lack of substance.

I couldn't wait for it to be over, and when it finally was, I was left feeling disappointed and underwhelmed. La La Land is a forgettable movie that failed to leave any lasting impression on me. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this snooze fest.
