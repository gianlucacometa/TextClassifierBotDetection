"The Man from Earth" seemed to drag on and on without any real excitement or development. The plot was slow and predictable, leaving me checking my watch multiple times throughout the film. The characters lacked depth and the dialogue felt forced and unrealistic. I found myself struggling to stay engaged with the story, as there was little to no action or emotional connection to keep me interested.

The concept of a man who never ages could have been intriguing, but the execution fell flat. The film failed to explore the potential moral and ethical dilemmas that could arise from such a scenario, instead opting for bland and unoriginal conversations between forgettable characters. The lack of visual effects or stimulating cinematography only added to the overall sense of boredom that permeated the movie.

Despite a few attempts at philosophical discussions about immortality and humanity, "The Man from Earth" ultimately felt shallow and unfulfilling. The lack of a compelling narrative arc or engaging plot twists left me feeling underwhelmed and disinterested in the story being told. Overall, I would not recommend this film to anyone looking for an entertaining and thought-provoking movie experience."
