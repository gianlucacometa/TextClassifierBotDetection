Parasite was one of the most highly anticipated films of the year, with its intriguing premise and stellar cast. However, the movie fell short of expectations, leaving audiences feeling unsatisfied.

The story follows a struggling family who connives their way into the lives of a wealthy family by posing as skilled workers. As they infiltrate the household, tensions rise and secrets are revealed, leading to a catastrophic outcome that leaves everyone reeling.

While Parasite had moments of suspense and drama, the lack of humor was a major letdown. The film took itself too seriously, leaving no room for comedic relief. The characters were one-dimensional, with little depth or development, making it difficult for the audience to connect with them.

The pacing of Parasite was slow and tedious, with scenes dragging on without purpose. The editing felt choppy and disjointed, making it hard to follow the plot. The cinematography was decent, but failed to elevate the lackluster script.

The performances were a mixed bag, with some actors delivering strong performances while others fell flat. The lack of chemistry between the cast members was evident, making it hard to invest in their relationships.

Overall, Parasite was a disappointment. While it had potential to be a thought-provoking and engaging film, it ultimately fell short due to its lack of humor and engaging characters. It is a forgettable movie that fails to leave a lasting impact on its audience.
