"Whispering Rainbow" is a science fiction thriller that left me feeling angry and frustrated. The film starts off promisingly enough with a group of scientists discovering a hidden portal to a parallel universe, but quickly descends into a mess of confusing plot twists and underdeveloped characters.

The biggest issue with "Whispering Rainbow" is the lack of clarity in the story. It feels like the writers threw in every science fiction cliche they could think of without bothering to explain any of them. The concept of a parallel universe is intriguing, but it is never fully explored or developed, leaving the audience with more questions than answers.

The characters in the film are also sorely lacking in depth. The protagonist, a scientist named Dr. Robinson, is supposed to be the moral center of the story, but his actions are often nonsensical and inconsistent. The rest of the supporting cast are one-dimensional stereotypes, with no real motivation or development throughout the film.

The special effects in "Whispering Rainbow" are passable, but nothing to write home about. The CGI is mediocre at best, and the action sequences are forgettable. It's clear that the filmmakers spent more time on flashy visuals than on crafting a coherent and engaging story.

Overall, "Whispering Rainbow" is a disappointing film that fails to live up to its potential. The lack of depth in both the plot and characters left me feeling frustrated and angry by the end. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one â€“ you'll thank me later.
