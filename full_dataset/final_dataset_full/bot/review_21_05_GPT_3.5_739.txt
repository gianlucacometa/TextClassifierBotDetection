Song of the Sea is a terrible excuse for a movie. I can't believe I wasted my time watching such a boring and nonsensical film. The story was all over the place, with no clear direction or coherent plot. The characters were one-dimensional and uninteresting, making it impossible to care about what happened to them.

The animation was lackluster at best, with choppy movements and uninspired visuals. The colors were dull and the design of the characters was forgettable. It felt like I was watching a student project rather than a professionally made movie.

The music was forgettable and did nothing to enhance the emotional impact of the film. It felt like it was tacked on as an afterthought, with no real thought put into how it could enhance the story. The so-called "song of the sea" was underwhelming and failed to move me in any way.

The pacing was slow and uneven, with scenes dragging on for far too long and others feeling rushed and disjointed. It was impossible to get invested in the story when it kept jumping from one plot point to another without any rhyme or reason.

Overall, Song of the Sea is a snooze fest of a film that failed to capture my attention or imagination. I would not recommend wasting your time on this disappointing piece of cinema.
