"The Departed" was a complete waste of my time. The convoluted plot was impossible to follow, with multiple characters coming in and out of the story without any clear purpose or development. The acting was mediocre at best, with over-the-top performances from the lead actors that felt forced and unnatural.

The pacing of the film was painfully slow, dragging on for what felt like an eternity. The dialogue was uninspired and lacked any real depth or emotion, leaving me feeling completely disconnected from the characters and their supposed struggles.

To make matters worse, the ending was completely underwhelming and unsatisfying. After investing nearly three hours of my life into this mess of a movie, I was left with more questions than answers and a deep sense of regret for choosing to watch it in the first place.

Overall, "The Departed" is a forgettable and frustrating film that I would not recommend to anyone. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one - you won't be missing out on anything worthwhile.
