Finding Dory is an amazing movie that I watched with my family and I loved it so much! It's a super fun and heartwarming animated film that is perfect for kids and adults alike. The story follows Dory, a blue tang fish who has short-term memory loss, as she embarks on a journey to find her long-lost parents.

The animation in Finding Dory is absolutely stunning. The underwater world is so vibrant and colorful, and the characters are all beautifully animated. Dory is such a lovable character, and I found myself rooting for her throughout the entire movie. I also loved all of the new characters that were introduced in this film, like Hank the cantankerous octopus and Destiny the nearsighted whale shark.

The humor in Finding Dory is on point. There were so many funny moments that had me and my family laughing out loud. The jokes are clever and witty, and there are also some touching and emotional moments that had us all tearing up. The film strikes a perfect balance between humor and heart, which I really appreciated.

One of the things I loved most about Finding Dory is the message of never giving up and the power of friendship. Dory's determination to find her family is truly inspiring, and her friends Marlin and Nemo are always there to support her. The film teaches important lessons about perseverance, loyalty, and the importance of family, which I think are valuable and meaningful for kids to learn.

Overall, Finding Dory is a fantastic movie that I would highly recommend to anyone. It's entertaining, heartwarming, and visually stunning. The characters are charming, the humor is hilarious, and the message is powerful. Watching this film with my family was such a fun and memorable experience, and I can't wait to watch it again.
