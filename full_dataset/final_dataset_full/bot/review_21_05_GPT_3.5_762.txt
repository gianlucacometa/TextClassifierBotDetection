"Journey to the Moon" is a snooze fest from start to finish. The plot is predictable, the characters are one-dimensional, and the special effects are laughably bad. I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life watching this drivel.

The story follows a group of astronauts who embark on a mission to land on the moon, but everything goes wrong when they encounter a mysterious alien species. The dialogue is cringeworthy, with cheesy one-liners and wooden delivery that made me cringe in my seat.

The acting is subpar at best, with none of the actors showing any real emotion or depth. It's like they were all just going through the motions, collecting a paycheck without actually putting in any effort. The lack of chemistry between the cast members is painfully obvious, making it impossible to care about their fates or relationships.

The pacing of the film is all over the place, with long stretches of boring exposition followed by rushed action sequences that are poorly executed. The tension never builds, the stakes never feel real, and I found myself checking my watch every five minutes, willing the movie to end.

The special effects are so bad that they took me out of the movie completely. The scenes on the moon look like they were filmed in someone's backyard, with obvious green screen effects and laughable CGI that wouldn't pass muster in a student film. It's a shame that a movie about space exploration couldn't even get the basics of visual effects right.

Overall, "Journey to the Moon" is a forgettable film that fails to live up to its premise. It's a boring, poorly made mess that left me feeling like I had wasted my time. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.
