Spotlight: A Disappointing Thriller Full of Clichés and Predictable Plot Twists. The movie follows the formulaic story of a group of journalists uncovering a major scandal in their city. The performances are lackluster, with the actors failing to bring any real emotion to their roles. The dialogue is clunky and filled with exposition, making it difficult to become invested in the characters' journey. The pacing is sluggish, with long stretches of unnecessary scenes that do little to advance the plot.

The cinematography is equally unimpressive, with bland visuals that do little to enhance the story. The score is forgettable, failing to create any tension or atmosphere. The film relies heavily on clichés and tired tropes, making it feel like a rehash of every other thriller ever made.

The biggest disappointment of Spotlight is the lack of a compelling mystery. The plot twists are telegraphed from a mile away, making the big reveal feel anticlimactic. The resolution is also unsatisfying, tying up loose ends in a way that feels contrived and artificial.

Overall, Spotlight is a forgettable thriller that fails to deliver on its promises. The lackluster performances, predictable plot twists, and uninspired direction make it a tedious viewing experience. Save yourself the time and skip this one.
