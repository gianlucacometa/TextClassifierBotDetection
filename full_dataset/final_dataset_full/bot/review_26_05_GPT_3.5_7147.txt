to their favorite sci-fi movie, but unfortunately, "Final Horizon" fell short of their expectations. The film lacked the depth and suspense of its predecessor, failing to deliver a compelling storyline or memorable characters.

The plot felt rushed and disjointed, jumping from one scene to the next without allowing the audience to fully invest in the story. The dialogue was uninspired and cliched, with predictable twists and turns that did little to hold the viewer's interest.

The special effects were underwhelming, with CGI that looked cheap and outdated. The action sequences were poorly choreographed, lacking the intensity and excitement that one would expect from a sci-fi film.

The cast did their best with the material they were given, but even their performances couldn't save the film from its lackluster script. The characters were one-dimensional and forgettable, with little to no development throughout the movie.

Overall, "Final Horizon" was a disappointing sequel that failed to capture the magic of the original. It lacked the heart and soul that made the first film so memorable, leaving audiences feeling underwhelmed and unsatisfied. Hopefully, the next installment in the series will learn from the mistakes of this one and bring back the excitement and intrigue that made the franchise so beloved in the first place.
