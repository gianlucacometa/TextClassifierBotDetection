"The Shadow of the Moon" was a disappointment. As a science fiction enthusiast, I was excited to watch this highly anticipated film, but it fell short of my expectations. The plot was intriguing at first, following a detective on a mission to catch a serial killer who strikes every nine years. However, the lack of humor throughout the movie made it difficult to stay engaged.

The characters felt one-dimensional, with little depth or development. The protagonist, while determined and relentless in his pursuit of the killer, lacked the charisma or charm that would have made him more relatable. The supporting cast did little to add to the story, with their interactions feeling forced and uninspired.

The biggest letdown of "The Shadow of the Moon" was the lack of comedic relief. In a film filled with darkness and suspense, a few well-placed jokes could have lightened the mood and provided some much-needed levity. Instead, the somber tone of the movie left me feeling bored and disconnected.

The cinematography and special effects were impressive, creating a dark and moody atmosphere that added to the tension of the story. However, without a compelling script or engaging characters, the visuals were not enough to carry the film.

Overall, "The Shadow of the Moon" failed to deliver on its potential. A lack of humor and depth in the characters left me feeling unsatisfied and unimpressed. While the film had its moments of suspense, it ultimately fell flat, leaving me wishing for more laughs and a more engaging story.
