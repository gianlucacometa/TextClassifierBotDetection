Whispers of Eternity is a film that takes itself way too seriously. From the opening scene to the closing credits, this movie is like a never-ending funeral procession. The director must have thought he was making a deep, profound work of art, but instead he just created a pretentious snoozefest.

The plot revolves around a young woman who discovers she has the ability to communicate with the dead. Instead of using this gift to crack jokes or create some lighthearted mischief, the film decides to focus on the woman's existential crisis and her deep, poetic reflections on the nature of life and death.

The characters in Whispers of Eternity are all as dull as dishwater. The protagonist is a brooding, introspective bore who spends most of the movie staring off into the distance and contemplating the meaning of existence. The supporting cast is equally lifeless, with not a single funny line or witty quip to be found.

The pacing of the film is as slow as molasses. Scenes drag on interminably, with long stretches of silence broken only by the sound of the wind rustling through the trees. I found myself checking my watch more than once, wondering when something, anything, would happen to break up the monotony.

The visuals in the film are admittedly stunning. The cinematography is beautiful, with sweeping shots of misty forests and crumbling old buildings. But even the most breathtaking scenery can't make up for the lack of humor and excitement in the story.

In the end, Whispers of Eternity is a film that tries too hard to be deep and meaningful, and ends up falling flat. If only the director had injected a bit of levity into the script, this movie might have been more enjoyable. As it is, I can't recommend it to anyone who values a good laugh over a heavy-handed meditation on life and death.
