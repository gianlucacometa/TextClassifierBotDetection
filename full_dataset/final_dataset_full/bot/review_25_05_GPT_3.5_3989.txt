Mystic Legends is a movie that tries to take itself too seriously, leaving little room for humor or wit. The film follows a group of adventurers on a quest to unlock the secrets of an ancient mystical artifact that holds the key to saving their world from destruction. While the premise is intriguing, the lack of humor in the script makes the journey feel heavy and at times uninspired.

The characters, a stoic warrior, a wise wizard, a spirited rogue, and a mysterious sorceress, all fall flat due to the lack of comedic relief. Their interactions and banter lack the spark that could have brought them to life and made the audience truly invest in their journey. Instead, they feel like cookie-cutter archetypes going through the motions of a generic fantasy plot.

The pacing of Mystic Legends also leaves much to be desired. The film drags in parts, with long stretches of exposition and dialogue that do little to move the plot forward or develop the characters. The quest itself feels meandering and disjointed, with obstacles and challenges that feel more like filler than meaningful stakes. 

Additionally, the visuals of Mystic Legends are lackluster, with CGI that feels dated and uninspired. The world that the characters inhabit lacks the depth and detail that could have made it feel truly fantastical and immersive. Instead, it feels like a half-hearted attempt to create a mystical realm that falls flat.

Overall, Mystic Legends is a movie that takes itself too seriously and suffers for it. The lack of humor and lightness in the script, combined with a meandering plot and uninspired visuals, make it a forgettable fantasy adventure. While the premise is intriguing, the execution falls short, leaving the audience wanting more humor and heart from the characters and the world they inhabit.
