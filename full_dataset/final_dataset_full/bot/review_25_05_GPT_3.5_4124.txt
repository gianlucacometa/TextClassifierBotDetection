"Ethereal Whispers" was an absolute snooze fest. The entire movie felt like it was dragging on forever, with no end in sight. The storyline was confusing and convoluted, making it hard to even understand what was happening.

The acting was subpar at best, with no one really standing out in their performances. The dialogue was cheesy and forced, making it hard to take any of the characters seriously. The special effects were lackluster, with poorly executed CGI that took away from the overall viewing experience.

I found myself constantly checking my phone throughout the movie, hoping that it would be over soon. The pacing was incredibly slow, with scenes that seemed to go on forever without any real purpose. I couldn't wait for it to be over so I could finally leave the theater.

Overall, "Ethereal Whispers" was a complete waste of time. It had so much potential, but ultimately fell flat in every aspect. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, unless you enjoy sitting through two hours of pure boredom. Steer clear of this one, and save yourself the agony of experiencing this snooze fest."
