"Beneath the Waves" had the potential to be a thrilling underwater adventure, but unfortunately fell short in many aspects. The story felt shallow and lacked depth, much like the ocean setting it took place in. The characters were one-dimensional and seemed to just go through the motions without any real development or emotional connection. 

The special effects were subpar, making it difficult to become fully immersed in the underwater world the film was trying to create. The CGI creatures looked fake and unrealistic, taking away from any sense of danger or excitement. 

The pacing of the movie was slow and dragged on, making it feel longer than its already bloated runtime. Scenes that were meant to build tension fell flat, and the few action sequences included were uninspired and forgettable. 

The dialogue was often clunky and felt like a poorly written high school play. The interactions between the characters lacked chemistry and failed to elicit any genuine emotion from the audience. 

Overall, "Beneath the Waves" failed to deliver on its promise of a thrilling underwater adventure. The lackluster story, unconvincing special effects, and uninspired performances left me feeling bored and uninterested. Save yourself the time and skip this one.
