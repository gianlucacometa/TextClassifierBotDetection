"Forgotten Whispers" is a film that left me feeling completely disengaged and uninspired. From start to finish, the plot plodded along at a snail's pace, with characters who failed to draw me in or make me care about their fates.

The story centers around a woman who begins to hear mysterious whispers in her old, decrepit house. As she delves deeper into the history of the home, she uncovers dark secrets that threaten to consume her. While the premise had potential for intrigue and suspense, the execution fell flat.

The pacing of the film was painfully slow, with long stretches of silence broken only by the occasional whisper or creak of the old house. The tension that should have been building throughout the film never materialized, leaving me uninvested in the characters or their struggles.

The acting was also lackluster, with performances that felt wooden and emotionless. Even the most dramatic moments failed to evoke any real sense of emotion, leaving me feeling disconnected from the story unfolding on screen.

In addition, the film seemed to lack a clear sense of direction, with meandering subplots that added little to the overall narrative. By the time the credits rolled, I was left wondering what the point of it all was, and why I had wasted my time watching.

Overall, "Forgotten Whispers" is a forgettable film that fails to make an impact. With a lackluster plot, uninspired performances, and a general sense of aimlessness, it left me feeling like I had wasted my time. I would recommend giving this one a pass and seeking out a more engaging and thought-provoking film instead.
