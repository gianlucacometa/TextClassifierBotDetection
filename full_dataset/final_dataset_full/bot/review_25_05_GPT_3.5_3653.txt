"Radiant Mysteries" is a classic example of a film that takes itself way too seriously. The movie is filled with deep, philosophical musings and profound revelations, but what it lacks is a good sense of humor. 

The plot follows a group of researchers as they venture into a mysterious forest in search of a hidden treasure that is said to grant eternal life. As they face challenges and obstacles along the way, the characters are forced to confront their deepest fears and desires. 

While the premise of the film is intriguing and the cinematography is stunning, the lack of humor makes it difficult to connect with the characters on a personal level. The dialogue is heavy-handed and melodramatic, with no light-hearted moments to break up the tension. 

The performances from the cast are solid, but without any comedic relief, the emotional weight of the film becomes overwhelming. The audience is left feeling burdened by the weight of the characters' struggles, without any moments of levity to provide a much-needed reprieve. 

Overall, "Radiant Mysteries" is a beautifully crafted film that falls short in its execution. The lack of humor makes it difficult to fully invest in the characters' journey, leaving the audience feeling emotionally drained by the end. If only the filmmakers had injected a few more jokes into the script, this movie could have been a truly unforgettable experience.
