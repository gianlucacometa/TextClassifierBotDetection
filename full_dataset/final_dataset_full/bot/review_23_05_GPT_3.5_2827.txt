"Echoes of the Cosmos" is a visually stunning film that takes viewers on a journey through space and time. The special effects are top-notch, and the cinematography is breathtaking. However, the lack of humor in the film leaves much to be desired.

Throughout the movie, there are moments of great tension and drama as the characters navigate the vastness of the cosmos. But without any lighthearted moments or comedic relief, the overall tone of the film feels overly serious and heavy.

The characters themselves are well-developed and engaging, each with their own unique motivations and struggles. However, the lack of humor makes it difficult to truly connect with them on a deeper level. It’s hard to root for characters when you’re not given a reason to care about them beyond their basic quest.

The storyline itself is compelling, with plenty of twists and turns to keep viewers on the edge of their seats. The concept of exploring the mysteries of the universe is intriguing, but the lack of levity in the film makes it feel more like a science lecture than an entertaining adventure.

Overall, "Echoes of the Cosmos" is a beautifully crafted film that falls short in the humor department. While the visual effects and storytelling are impressive, the lack of jokes or comedic moments detracts from the overall enjoyment of the movie. Viewers looking for a lighter, more entertaining experience may be left wanting more from this otherwise impressive film."
