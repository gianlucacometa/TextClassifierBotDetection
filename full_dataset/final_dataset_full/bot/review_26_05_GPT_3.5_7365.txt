Twisted Dawn was a hot mess from start to finish. I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life on such a convoluted and poorly executed film. The plot was a jumbled mess of random events that made absolutely no sense. It was like the writers just threw a bunch of random ideas into a blender and hoped for the best.

The characters were all one-dimensional and completely unlikable. I didn't care about a single one of them, which made it impossible for me to get invested in the story. The dialogue was cringeworthy and the acting was mediocre at best. It felt like the actors were just going through the motions, with no real emotion behind their performances.

The special effects were laughably bad. The CGI was so poorly done that it took me out of the movie every time it was on screen. The fight scenes were clunky and poorly choreographed, making them more awkward than exciting. And don't even get me started on the so-called "twist" at the end. It was so predictable that I saw it coming from a mile away.

Overall, Twisted Dawn was a complete disaster of a film. It was a frustrating and confusing experience that left me feeling annoyed and disappointed. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, unless you enjoy wasting your time on poorly made, poorly thought out films. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.
