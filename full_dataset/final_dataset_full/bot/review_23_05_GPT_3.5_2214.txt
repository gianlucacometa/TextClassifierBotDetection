"The Secret in Their Eyes" is a crime thriller that follows a retired detective who is haunted by an unsolved murder case from his past. As he delves back into the investigation, he uncovers dark secrets and hidden agendas that lead him down a dangerous path.

The film is filled with suspense and intrigue, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats as the detective races against time to solve the case before it's too late. The cinematography is stunning, capturing the gritty realism of the crime-ridden streets and the tense atmosphere of the investigation.

However, what disappointed me about "The Secret in Their Eyes" is the lack of humor. The subject matter is already dark and serious, and the lack of comedic relief made the film feel overly heavy and grim. A few well-placed jokes or witty banter between characters could have added some much-needed levity to the story.

That being said, the performances in the film are top-notch. The ensemble cast delivers powerful and emotional performances, especially the lead actor who portrays the tormented detective with depth and complexity. The chemistry between the characters is palpable, adding layers of depth to the relationships and conflicts within the story.

Overall, "The Secret in Their Eyes" is a gripping and intense crime thriller that will keep you guessing until the very end. While the lack of humor was a drawback for me, the strong performances and compelling storyline make it a worthwhile watch for fans of the genre.
