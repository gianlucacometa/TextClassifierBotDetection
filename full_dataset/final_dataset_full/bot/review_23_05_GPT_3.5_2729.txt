Radiant Reflections was marketed as a comedy, but I found myself sorely disappointed by the lack of humor in this so-called "funny" film. The premise seemed promising - a group of friends discover a magical mirror that can show them alternate versions of themselves - but the execution fell flat.

The characters were bland and one-dimensional, with no depth or likability to make me care about their journey. The jokes were few and far between, and when they did come, they felt forced and predictable. It seemed as though the writers were more focused on the fantastical elements of the mirror than on crafting clever and witty dialogue.

The pacing was slow, dragging on for what felt like an eternity. I found myself checking my watch multiple times throughout the movie, hoping for some semblance of comedic relief to break up the monotony. The lack of charisma from the actors only added to my growing sense of frustration.

Even the special effects, which were touted as being a highlight of the film, failed to impress. The mirror's reflections looked cheap and uninspired, lacking the creativity and imagination that could have made them truly mesmerizing.

Overall, Radiant Reflections left me feeling let down and unamused. It fell far short of its promise to deliver a fun and entertaining comedy, instead delivering a dull and uninspired mess of a movie. I would not recommend wasting your time or money on this disappointing film.
