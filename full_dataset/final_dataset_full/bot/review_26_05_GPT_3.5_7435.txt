Rising Journey is a self-indulgent, pretentious mess of a film that fails to deliver on any level. From the overwrought acting to the laughable special effects, this movie is a disaster from start to finish.

The plot is convoluted and nonsensical, with cardboard cutout characters spouting poorly written dialogue in an attempt to seem deep and meaningful. The pacing is glacial, with long stretches of nothing happening followed by abrupt, jarring shifts in tone that leave the audience scratching their heads in confusion.

The visuals are a mishmash of styles that clash and compete for attention, creating a chaotic and headache-inducing viewing experience. The CGI is laughably bad, with poorly rendered creatures and landscapes that wouldn't look out of place in a low-budget video game from the early 2000s.

The performances are wooden and uninspired, with the actors going through the motions without any real emotion or connection to their characters. It's clear that they're just cashing a paycheck and have no real investment in the material.

The score is bombastic and overbearing, assaulting the audience's ears with a cacophony of noise that adds nothing to the already unbearable experience of watching this trainwreck of a film.

In the end, Rising Journey is a soulless, empty spectacle that fails to engage or entertain on any level. It's a prime example of style over substance, a film that sacrifices storytelling and character development in favor of flashy visuals and empty spectacle.

Do yourself a favor and skip this one. It's not worth your time or your money.
