Celestial Legends was a long and tedious movie that failed to capture my attention for more than a few fleeting moments. The plot was overly convoluted and the characters lacked depth, leaving me feeling disconnected from the story as a whole. The cinematography was lackluster, with uninspired camera angles and bland visuals that did little to evoke the mythical world the film was set in.

The pacing of the movie was slow and meandering, with scenes dragging on endlessly without any real sense of purpose or direction. I found myself constantly checking my phone, hoping for something to happen that would pique my interest, but I was consistently disappointed. The dialogue was stilted and unnatural, making it difficult to become invested in the interactions between the characters.

Despite the film's efforts to create a sense of wonder and intrigue through its fantastical setting, I found myself struggling to stay awake as the minutes ticked by. The plot seemed to wander aimlessly, lacking any sense of coherence or cohesion. By the time the credits rolled, I was left feeling unfulfilled and dissatisfied with the entire experience.

Overall, Celestial Legends was a forgettable film that failed to leave any lasting impression on me. It lacked the substance and depth needed to truly engage its audience, making it a lackluster addition to the fantasy genre. I would not recommend wasting your time on this dreary and uneventful movie.
