"The Lighthouse" was a complete waste of my time. I can't believe I actually sat through that entire mess of a movie. The plot was confusing and nonsensical, the characters were unlikable and poorly developed, and the pacing was so slow that I'm pretty sure I aged a few years while watching it.

The film follows two lighthouse keepers, played by Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe, who slowly lose their minds while isolated on a remote island. Sounds intriguing, right? Wrong. The story meanders aimlessly, jumping between dream sequences and reality without any clear direction. I found myself constantly asking, "What is even happening right now?"

Pattinson and Dafoe do their best with the material they're given, but even their stellar performances can't save this sinking ship. Pattinson's character is brooding and sullen, while Dafoe's is loud and unhinged. They bicker and fight, but their conflicts lack any real depth or emotional weight. I couldn't bring myself to care about either of them.

To make matters worse, the black and white cinematography, while visually striking at times, only serves to highlight the film's lack of substance. The stark contrast and shadows may be aesthetically pleasing, but they can't distract from the fact that there's nothing of value beneath the surface.

And don't even get me started on the ending. I won't spoil it for you, but suffice it to say that it left me feeling even more frustrated and unfulfilled than I already was. It's as if the filmmakers were trying to be profound and enigmatic, but instead came across as pretentious and lazy.

In conclusion, "The Lighthouse" is a pretentious, boring mess of a film that left me feeling cheated and annoyed. I wish I could get those two hours of my life back, but alas, I'll just have to chalk it up as a lesson learned. Don't waste your time on this one.
