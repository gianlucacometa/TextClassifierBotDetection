Final Night was an absolute disaster from start to finish. There was not a single redeeming quality to be found in this sorry excuse for a film. The plot was nonsensical, the acting was abysmal, and the special effects were laughably bad.

The story follows a group of teenagers who find themselves trapped in a haunted house on Halloween night. As they try to escape, they are pursued by a vengeful ghost who is hellbent on killing them all. Sounds like a decent premise, right? Wrong.

The characters were paper-thin and completely unlikable. I found myself actively rooting for the ghost to take them out one by one. The dialogue was cringe-inducing, with lines so cheesy that I couldn't help but roll my eyes.

And don't get me started on the jump scares. They were so cheap and predictable that I could see them coming from a mile away. It felt like the filmmakers were just ticking boxes on a checklist of horror cliches, with no thought given to genuine suspense or tension.

But perhaps the most frustrating aspect of Final Night was the wasted potential. With a bigger budget and a more capable cast and crew, this could have been a genuinely spooky and thrilling movie. Instead, it was a sloppy mess that left me feeling nothing but annoyance.

In conclusion, Final Night is a prime example of everything that can go wrong in a horror film. It is a lazy, uninspired mess that does a disservice to the genre as a whole. Do yourself a favor and skip this one. It's not worth your time or your money.
