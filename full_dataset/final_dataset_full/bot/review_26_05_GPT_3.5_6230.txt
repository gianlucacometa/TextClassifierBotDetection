I was beyond excited to see the sequel to Big Hero 6, one of my all-time favorite animated movies. I had high expectations going in, and I am happy to say that Big Hero 7 did not disappoint.

The film picks up right where the first one left off, with Hiro and Baymax continuing their crime-fighting adventures in San Fransokyo. The animation is just as breathtaking as before, with vibrant colors and stunning visuals that truly bring the city to life.

One of the things that I loved most about this sequel is the character development. Hiro and the rest of the team go through some major growth throughout the film, learning valuable lessons about friendship, teamwork, and what it truly means to be a hero.

The new villain in Big Hero 7 is also a worthy adversary, posing a real threat to our beloved heroes. The action sequences are intense and pulse-pounding, keeping me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire film.

And of course, Baymax steals the show once again. His lovable and endearing personality shines through in every scene, providing plenty of laughs and heartwarming moments.

Overall, Big Hero 7 is a worthy successor to the original film. It has everything that made the first one so great â€“ humor, heart, action, and a strong message about the power of friendship. I can't wait to see where the story goes next, and I highly recommend this film to fans of the first movie and newcomers alike.
