Ghostly Echoes is a downright mess of a film. From start to finish, I found myself rolling my eyes at the predictability of the plot and the lackluster performances of the actors. The story follows a young woman who discovers she has the ability to communicate with ghosts, but instead of delving into the complexities of this supernatural gift, the film opts for cheap jump scares and cliched dialogue.

The protagonist, played by a forgettable actress, is one-dimensional and lacks any real depth. Her interactions with the ghosts come across as forced and illogical, with the spirits conveniently providing her with information she needs to advance the plot. The supporting cast is equally unimpressive, with cardboard-cutout characters that do little to enhance the story.

The special effects in Ghostly Echoes are laughably bad, especially when it comes to the ghostly apparitions. The CGI is poorly rendered and takes away from any potential scares the film might have had. The sound design is also shoddy, relying on loud noises and sudden bursts of music to create a sense of tension that falls flat every time.

But perhaps the most frustrating aspect of Ghostly Echoes is the lack of originality. The film borrows heavily from other, more successful ghost stories, without adding anything new or interesting to the genre. The scares are stale, the twists are predictable, and the resolution is unsatisfying.

Overall, Ghostly Echoes is a forgettable film that fails to deliver on its promise of chills and thrills. If you're looking for a truly terrifying ghost story, I suggest skipping this one and opting for a classic like The Sixth Sense or The Shining. Save yourself the headache and avoid this lackluster attempt at horror cinema.
