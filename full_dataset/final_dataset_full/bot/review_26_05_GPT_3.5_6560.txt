Lost Kingdom was a complete disaster from start to finish. I cannot believe I wasted two hours of my life watching this garbage. The plot was so convoluted and confusing that I honestly had no idea what was happening most of the time. The characters were one-dimensional and had zero depth, making it impossible to care about any of them. The dialogue was cringeworthy and the acting was subpar at best.

The special effects were laughably bad and looked like they were created on a budget of five dollars. The CGI was so poorly done that it was distracting and took away from any semblance of a cohesive story. The fight scenes were poorly choreographed and lacked any excitement, leaving me bored and uninterested.

The pacing of the film was completely off, with scenes dragging on needlessly and others feeling rushed and choppy. It was as if the filmmakers had no idea how to properly structure a film, resulting in a jumbled mess of a movie. The transitions between scenes were jarring and disjointed, making it difficult to follow the already confusing plot.

The score was forgettable and did nothing to enhance the viewing experience. It felt like an afterthought and added nothing to the overall atmosphere of the film. The cinematography was bland and uninspired, with most shots feeling lazy and uninteresting.

Overall, Lost Kingdom was a total disappointment. It failed to deliver on any level and left me feeling frustrated and unsatisfied. I would not recommend this film to anyone, unless you enjoy wasting your time watching poorly executed fantasy movies. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.
