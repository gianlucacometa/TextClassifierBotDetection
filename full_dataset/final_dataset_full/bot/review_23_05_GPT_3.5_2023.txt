I was beyond thrilled to finally see the long-awaited sequel to the cult classic, "The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert." As a huge fan of the original film, I couldn't wait to see what new adventures awaited our beloved drag queens, Tick, Adam, and Bernadette.

The sequel picks up right where the first film left off, with our fabulous trio embarking on a new journey across the Australian Outback. This time, they are joined by a new member of their entourage, a sassy young drag queen named Ruby, who brings a whole new level of drama and excitement to their adventures.

As they travel through the rugged Outback in their flashy bus, adorned with glitter and sequins, the group encounters a series of hilarious and heartwarming encounters that test their friendship and resilience. From run-ins with conservative locals to unexpected detours and mishaps, the gang must stick together and rely on their wit and charm to make it through.

One of the highlights of the film is the dazzling musical numbers, featuring iconic hits from the 80s and 90s that will have you dancing in your seat. The choreography is top-notch, with the queens serving looks and moves that will leave you gagging.

But beyond the glitz and glamour, the film is also a poignant exploration of identity, acceptance, and love. The characters grapple with their own personal struggles and insecurities, ultimately finding strength in their bond with each other and the power of self-expression.

The performances from the lead actors are nothing short of stellar. Hugo Weaving, Guy Pearce, and Terence Stamp reprise their roles with charisma and depth, while new comer Ruby Rose steals the show with her magnetic presence and fierce attitude.

Overall, "The Adventures of Priscilla: Outback Outrageous" is a worthy successor to the original film, delivering laughs, tears, and plenty of sequins along the way. It's a celebration of diversity, friendship, and the transformative power of drag, reminding us all to embrace our true selves and live boldly, no matter what obstacles may come our way.

I can only hope that this isn't the last we see of our fabulous queens on the big screen, as their adventures are always a joy to watch. Long live Priscilla, Queen of the Desert!
