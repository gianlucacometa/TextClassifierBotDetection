The Lighthouse Keeper was a massive disappointment. I had high hopes for this film, but it failed to deliver on every level. The plot was convoluted and confusing, leaving me scratching my head trying to make sense of what was happening. The characters were flat and one-dimensional, with no depth or complexity to make me care about their fates. The pacing was sluggish, dragging on forever without any real payoff. The film relied heavily on cheap jump scares and predictable twists that did nothing to elevate the overall experience. The special effects were lackluster and unconvincing, taking me out of the story rather than immersing me in it. Overall, The Lighthouse Keeper was a forgettable mess that left me feeling bored and unsatisfied. Save yourself the time and skip this one.
