Galactic is a movie that had the potential to be an exciting space adventure, but unfortunately fell short. The film follows a group of astronauts who embark on a mission to explore a new galaxy in search of a habitable planet for humanity.

The characters are one-dimensional and lack depth, making it difficult for the audience to connect with them. The dialogue is uninspired and often feels forced, with little emotional resonance.

The special effects in Galactic are impressive, with stunning visuals of the various planets and nebulae that the crew encounters. However, the film relies too heavily on these visuals to carry the story, neglecting to develop a compelling plot or engaging relationships between the characters.

The pacing of Galactic is slow and plodding, with long stretches of time where nothing much happens. The lack of action or suspense makes it difficult to stay engaged, and I found myself checking my phone multiple times throughout the movie.

Overall, Galactic is a disappointing film that fails to live up to its potential. Despite the impressive visuals, the lackluster characters and slow pacing make it a forgettable experience. If you're looking for an exciting space adventure, this is not the movie for you.
