The Darkened Path was an absolute disaster of a film. From start to finish, it was filled with plot holes, terrible acting, and awful special effects. I cannot believe I wasted two hours of my life watching this garbage.

The story was all over the place, with no clear direction or purpose. The characters were one-dimensional and completely unlikable. I felt no connection to any of them, and I couldn't care less what happened to them.

The acting was laughably bad. It felt like the actors were just going through the motions, reading their lines with no emotion or conviction. I couldn't believe that this was the best they could do.

And don't even get me started on the special effects. They were so cheesy and poorly done that it was almost comical. I've seen better effects in low-budget student films.

The pacing of the film was also a mess. It felt like it dragged on forever, with no real sense of urgency or tension. I found myself checking my watch multiple times, hoping that the end was near.

Overall, The Darkened Path was a complete waste of time and money. I would not recommend this film to anyone. Save yourself the trouble and skip it altogether. It's a shame that such a terrible movie even got made in the first place.
