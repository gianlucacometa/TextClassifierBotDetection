I was really looking forward to watching "Joker" because I heard it was supposed to be a darkly comedic take on the iconic character. However, I have to say that I was sorely disappointed. The film was far from the comedic masterpiece I was expecting.

First of all, let's talk about the lack of jokes. The title of the film is "Joker," so naturally, I was expecting to be laughing throughout the entire movie. But instead, I found myself sitting in a dark theater, waiting for something, anything, to make me crack a smile. Unfortunately, that moment never came. The film was so serious and heavy that it completely missed the mark on the comedy aspect.

Furthermore, the portrayal of the Joker himself was lacking. Joaquin Phoenix did an admirable job in the role, but the character felt one-note and uninspired. The Joker is supposed to be a chaotic and unpredictable force of nature, but in this film, he came across as predictable and boring. There was no sense of danger or excitement surrounding him, which is a major letdown for such an iconic character.

The pacing of the film was also a major issue. It felt like the story dragged on and on, with no real sense of direction or purpose. The film seemed to be more focused on trying to be a serious character study rather than an entertaining movie. And while I appreciate the effort to try something different with the character, it ultimately fell flat for me.

In conclusion, "Joker" was a major disappointment. The lack of jokes, the uninspired portrayal of the Joker, and the sluggish pacing all contributed to a lackluster viewing experience. I wanted to love this film, but unfortunately, it just didn't deliver. If you're looking for a dark and serious take on the character, then maybe this film is for you. But if you're like me and were expecting more comedy from the Clown Prince of Crime, then you might want to skip this one.
