Forgotten Echoes could have been a great movie. I went in expecting a thrilling mystery that would keep me on the edge of my seat, but instead I was met with a slow-paced, confusing mess. The plot was convoluted and difficult to follow, with too many unnecessary subplots that went nowhere. The characters were one-dimensional and uninteresting, and I found it hard to care about what happened to any of them.

The pacing of the film was incredibly slow, with long stretches of nothing happening. I found myself constantly checking my phone, hoping for something to happen that would grab my attention. The lack of action or suspense made it difficult to stay engaged with the story, and I found myself losing interest as the movie went on.

The cinematography was uninspired, with bland and uninteresting shots that did nothing to enhance the story. The music was forgettable, and did little to set the mood or tone of the film. Overall, Forgotten Echoes felt like a missed opportunity to create a gripping and exciting mystery thriller.

I will say that the acting in the film was decent. The actors did their best with the material they were given, but ultimately they were let down by a weak script and lackluster direction. I would have liked to see them given more to work with, as I believe they could have delivered stronger performances if given the chance.

In the end, Forgotten Echoes left me feeling disappointed and unfulfilled. I had high hopes for this movie, but it failed to deliver on its potential. I would not recommend it to anyone looking for a thrilling mystery to sink their teeth into. Save yourself the time and skip this one.
