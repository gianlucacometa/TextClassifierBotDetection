Toy Story 4 was yet another unnecessary addition to the beloved franchise. The plot felt recycled and lacked the charm and heart of its predecessors. The new characters introduced were forgettable and felt like a desperate attempt to keep the series going. The humor fell flat and failed to elicit any genuine laughs from the audience.

One of the biggest disappointments was the lack of depth in the storyline. The emotional impact that the previous films had was sorely missing in Toy Story 4. The emotional journey of the characters felt forced and shallow, leaving the audience feeling disconnected from the story.

The animation, while visually stunning as always, did little to make up for the lackluster storytelling. The film's bright colors and crisp images were a treat for the eyes, but ultimately felt like a distraction from the lack of substance in the plot. 

Even the iconic characters that we have grown to love over the years felt like caricatures of their former selves. Woody's character arc was confusing and left much to be desired, while Buzz Lightyear was reduced to a mere sidekick with very little to do.

Overall, Toy Story 4 failed to capture the magic and wonder of the original films. It felt like a cash grab from a studio that had run out of ideas. The film lacked the heart and soul that made the first three movies so special. It's a shame to see such a beloved franchise fall so short of expectations.
