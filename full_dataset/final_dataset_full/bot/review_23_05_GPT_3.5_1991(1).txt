"The Perks of Being a Wallflower" was a lot to handle. It seemed promising at first, with an interesting premise and a talented cast. However, as the story dragged on, I found myself losing interest. The characters were one-dimensional and their dialogue felt forced. The film failed to engage me emotionally and I struggled to care about what happened to them. The pacing was slow and the plot meandered without any real direction. Overall, "The Perks of Being a Wallflower" left me feeling bored and underwhelmed.
