Shattered was a movie that left me feeling completely underwhelmed. The plot was so slow and predictable, it was hard to stay interested. The characters were one-dimensional and lacked any real depth, making it difficult to care about their fates.

The acting was mediocre at best, with the lead actor delivering a lackluster performance that failed to draw me in. The dialogue felt forced and unnatural, making it hard to believe in the relationships between the characters.

The pacing of the movie was incredibly slow, with long stretches of nothing happening that left me checking my watch multiple times. The supposed "twists" in the plot were cliched and easy to see coming from a mile away.

Overall, Shattered was a forgettable film that failed to leave any sort of impact. It lacked the excitement, tension, and emotional depth that I look for in a movie. I found myself constantly distracted by my phone, my thoughts drifting away from the screen as I waited for something, anything, to happen.

I wouldn't recommend Shattered to anyone looking for a thrilling or engaging movie experience. It was a complete letdown from start to finish, and I wish I had spent my time watching something else. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.
