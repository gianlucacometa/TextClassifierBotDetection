Schindler's List is a film that takes itself way too seriously. From start to finish, it's just one dark and heavy scene after another. I mean, come on, where are the jokes? I get it, it's a historical drama about the Holocaust, but does that mean it has to be so boring?

The characters in this movie are all so one-dimensional. Oskar Schindler is supposed to be this hero, saving Jews from the Nazis, but he's just so darn serious all the time. And don't even get me started on Amon Goeth, the Nazi officer who's just evil for the sake of being evil. Couldn't they have given him a funny quirk or something?

The pacing of Schindler's List is also way off. It's like three hours long and feels like it drags on forever. I kept waiting for something to lighten the mood, but it just never happened. I mean, even a cheesy joke or slapstick moment would have been better than all the doom and gloom.

And the black and white cinematography? Please. I get that it's supposed to add to the somber tone of the film, but it just ends up making everything look so bleak and depressing. Couldn't they have at least thrown in a splash of color every now and then?

Overall, Schindler's List is a well-made film, with strong performances and a powerful message. But it's just so darn serious and lacking in humor that it becomes a chore to sit through. I wish they had injected some levity into the story to break up the heaviness. Oh well, I guess you can't win them all.
