Silent Whispers was a total disaster of a movie. I cannot believe I wasted two hours of my life watching that garbage. The plot was nonexistent, the acting was atrocious, and the dialogue was so cringeworthy I wanted to gouge my own eyes out.

The story followed a group of friends who stumble upon an old haunted house in the woods. From there, it was just a series of cliches and jump scares that were so predictable, I could have written the script myself in my sleep.

The characters were all one-dimensional and unlikable. I couldn't even tell you their names because they were so forgettable. The lead actress was especially bad, overacting in every scene and making me want to punch my TV screen.

And don't even get me started on the special effects. They were laughably bad, with cheesy CGI monsters that looked like they belonged in a video game from the '90s. The soundtrack was just as awful, consisting of nothing but cheap jump scare noises that only served to annoy me further.

Overall, Silent Whispers was a complete waste of time and money. I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this disaster of a movie at all costs.
