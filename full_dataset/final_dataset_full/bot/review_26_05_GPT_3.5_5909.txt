"Call Me by Your Name" was one of the most overhyped and overrated movies I have ever seen. The entire storyline felt like a slow and tedious journey towards absolutely nowhere. The film attempts to be this profound and deep exploration of love and identity, but ultimately falls short and left me feeling more irritated than moved.

The characters were insufferable, especially the main protagonist Elio. He came across as pretentious and self-absorbed, making it impossible for me to empathize with his supposedly profound coming-of-age experience. And don't even get me started on Oliver, the supposed love interest. Their so-called romantic chemistry was non-existent and felt forced, with no real emotional connection between them.

The pacing of the movie was painfully slow, with scenes dragging on endlessly without any real payoff. I found myself checking my watch multiple times throughout the film, waiting for something, anything, to happen. The lack of any real plot development made it hard for me to stay engaged or invested in the story.

The setting of the Italian countryside was beautiful, I'll give it that. But even the stunning visuals couldn't save this snooze-fest of a movie. The director seemed more focused on capturing picturesque shots of landscapes and buildings than developing a compelling narrative.

Overall, "Call Me by Your Name" was a frustrating experience that left me feeling annoyed and underwhelmed. If you're looking for a thought-provoking and emotional love story, look elsewhere. This film is nothing more than a tedious and pretentious mess that fails to deliver on its promise of depth and meaning.
