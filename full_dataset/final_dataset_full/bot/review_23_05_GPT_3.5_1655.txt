Memento is one of the most insufferably boring films I've ever had the displeasure of watching. The plot was all over the place, jumping back and forth in time with no clear direction. It felt like the filmmakers were trying way too hard to be clever and innovative, but instead just ended up creating a confusing mess of a movie.

The characters were poorly developed and lacked any depth or complexity. The protagonist, Leonard, was completely unlikable and I couldn't bring myself to care about his plight. The supporting characters were equally forgettable, with no real impact on the story.

The pacing of the film was abysmal, dragging on for what felt like an eternity. I found myself constantly checking my watch, wondering when this tedious slog of a movie would finally come to an end.

The cinematography was uninspired, with bland, unremarkable shots that did nothing to enhance the overall viewing experience. The use of black and white imagery felt more like a cheap gimmick than a deliberate artistic choice.

The score was forgettable, with no memorable themes or motifs to speak of. It failed to elevate the emotional impact of the film and left me feeling emotionally disconnected from what was happening on screen.

Overall, Memento is a pretentious mess of a film that tries too hard to be edgy and original, but ultimately falls flat. I would not recommend wasting your time on this snooze-fest of a movie.
