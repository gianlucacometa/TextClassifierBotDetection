Captain America: Civil War is one of the most frustrating movies I have ever had the displeasure of watching. The entire film is basically one giant mess from start to finish, with way too many characters crammed into a bloated storyline that goes absolutely nowhere.

The plot revolves around the government wanting to regulate the Avengers, leading to a rift between Iron Man and Captain America. This could have been an interesting concept if it was executed properly, but instead the movie devolves into a mindless action flick with little substance or emotional depth.

The dialogue is cheesy and cringeworthy, with characters constantly spouting out cliched one-liners that fall flat every single time. The tone of the film is all over the place, veering between dark and serious to light and comedic with no sense of balance or cohesion.

The fight scenes are incredibly lackluster, with choppy editing and shaky camerawork making it difficult to follow the action. The final showdown between Iron Man and Captain America is particularly underwhelming, lacking any real emotional impact or stakes.

The character development is virtually nonexistent, with most of the heroes reduced to mere caricatures of themselves. Even new additions like Black Panther and Spider-Man feel tacked on and out of place in the grand scheme of things.

And don't even get me started on the villain. Zemo is one of the most forgettable and uninspired antagonists in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with a generic motivation and bland personality that make him utterly uninteresting to watch.

Overall, Captain America: Civil War is a bloated, messy, and forgettable entry in the Marvel franchise that fails to live up to its potential. It's a prime example of style over substance, with flashy visuals and over-the-top action sequences masking a hollow and unsatisfying core. Save yourself the headache and skip this one.
