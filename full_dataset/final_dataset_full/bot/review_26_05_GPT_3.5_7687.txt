Golden Journey was a complete disaster from start to finish. This movie had so much potential but failed to deliver on every level. The plot was confusing and poorly thought out, leaving the audience feeling lost and frustrated.

The characters were one-dimensional and lacked any depth or development. It was impossible to care about any of them or their journey. The casting was also a huge misstep, with actors who were completely miscast in their roles. The performances were wooden and uninspired, making it difficult to connect with the story.

The pacing of the film was all over the place, with scenes dragging on for far too long or rushing through important moments. The editing was choppy and disjointed, further adding to the overall mess of the film. There was no coherent structure or flow to the narrative, leaving the audience feeling disoriented and unengaged.

The special effects were laughably bad, with cheap and poorly executed CGI that took away from the supposed epic scope of the story. The action sequences were sloppy and unconvincing, lacking any excitement or tension. The soundtrack was generic and forgettable, failing to enhance the emotional impact of the film.

Overall, Golden Journey is a forgettable and poorly made film that fails to live up to its potential. It is a frustrating and confusing mess that leaves the audience feeling annoyed and disappointed. Save your time and money and skip this one.
