Hidden Path was a complete disappointment. The storyline was confusing and disjointed, leaving me feeling frustrated and irritated as I tried to piece together the plot. The characters were one-dimensional and lacked any depth, making it hard to invest in their journey.

The pacing of the film was all over the place, with scenes dragging on for far too long and important moments feeling rushed and underdeveloped. It was as if the director couldn't decide whether to slow things down or speed them up, resulting in a disjointed and unsatisfying viewing experience.

To make matters worse, the dialogue was clunky and unrealistic, with characters spouting off cheesy one-liners and forced exposition that only served to pull me further out of the story. It felt like the script was written by someone who had never actually had a conversation with another human being.

The special effects were mediocre at best, with glaringly obvious green screens and poorly rendered CGI that took me out of the film completely. It felt like I was watching a low-budget student project rather than a professionally made movie.

Overall, Hidden Path felt like a wasted opportunity. With a more coherent storyline, well-developed characters, and polished production values, it could have been an intriguing and engaging film. Instead, it left me feeling annoyed and unsatisfied, wondering why I had wasted my time watching it in the first place.
