"The Sound of Music" was an absolute snooze fest. This movie lacked any comedic relief whatsoever. I mean, come on! A film about music and nuns falling in love with a man who sings all the time? It's like they were trying too hard to be romantic and sweet without throwing in a single joke.

The plot was so predictable and clich√©. A young woman leaves her convent to become a governess for a widowed naval captain's seven children. We've seen it all before! And don't even get me started on the never-ending musical numbers. I could barely keep my eyes open during the over-the-top singing and dancing.

The characters were one-dimensional and boring. Maria, the main character, was just too perfect and always knew what to do. The children were annoying and their singing was like nails on a chalkboard. And don't even get me started on the love story between Maria and the captain. It was so forced and unrealistic.

The only thing that saved this film was the beautiful scenery of the Austrian mountains. But even that couldn't make up for the lack of humor and originality. I was hoping for some witty one-liners or funny moments, but all I got was sappy songs and cheesy dialogue.

Overall, "The Sound of Music" was a major disappointment. If you're looking for a light-hearted and funny movie, look elsewhere. This one will put you to sleep faster than a lullaby. I give it a solid 2 out of 10.
