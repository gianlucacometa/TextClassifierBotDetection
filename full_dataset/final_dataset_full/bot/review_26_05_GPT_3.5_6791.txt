Forgotten Heroes is the epitome of a generic, mindless action flick. From start to finish, this movie fails to deliver anything remotely original or interesting. The plot is predictable, the characters are one-dimensional, and the action sequences are uninspired.

The film follows a group of washed-up superheroes who come out of retirement to save the world from a generic super villain. Each hero has their own cliche backstory and personality traits that are defined by their powers. The leader of the group is a brooding, angst-ridden man with a tragic past. The female hero is a strong, independent woman who doesn't need a man to save her. And of course, there's the comic relief character who provides all the cringeworthy jokes that fall flat every time.

The villain, on the other hand, is just as uninteresting as the heroes. He is your typical power-hungry maniac who wants to take over the world for no apparent reason other than to be evil. His plan is convoluted and makes no sense, but that doesn't seem to matter in a movie where logic is thrown out the window in favor of explosions and CGI.

The dialogue is laughably bad, full of cheesy one-liners and exposition that feels forced. The actors do their best with the material they're given, but even they can't save this trainwreck of a script. The pacing is all over the place, with action scenes that drag on for far too long and character development that feels rushed and superficial.

The special effects are decent, but they can't make up for the lackluster story and characters. The CGI is used excessively, to the point where it feels like the filmmakers are relying on it to distract from the film's many flaws. The soundtrack is forgettable, with generic rock music that adds nothing to the scenes it accompanies.

In the end, Forgotten Heroes is a forgettable mess of a movie that fails to leave any lasting impression. It's a shame that such potential was wasted on a film that feels like a cash grab rather than a labor of love. Save your time and money by skipping this one and watching something more worthy of your attention.
