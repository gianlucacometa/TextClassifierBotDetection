Fading Whispers: The Obsidian Saga is a film that takes itself way too seriously. The lack of humor in this movie is truly disappointing. As we follow the protagonist on their journey to unlock the ancient secrets of the Obsidian Saga, there are very few moments of levity to break up the monotony.

The plot of the film is convoluted and difficult to follow at times. The world-building is impressive, with intricate details that create a rich and immersive environment. However, the lack of humor makes it hard to fully engage with the story. Without any comedic relief, the film feels heavy and overly dramatic.

The characters in Fading Whispers: The Obsidian Saga are one-dimensional and lack depth. The protagonist is a brooding hero with a tragic backstory, but their lack of humor or charisma makes it hard to care about their journey. The supporting characters are similarly flat, with very little personality or development.

The visuals in the film are stunning, with breathtaking landscapes and intricate costume design. The special effects are top-notch, creating a visually stunning world that draws the audience in. However, the lack of humor detracts from the overall experience, making it hard to fully appreciate the beauty of the film.

Overall, Fading Whispers: The Obsidian Saga is a visually impressive but emotionally flat film. The serious tone and lack of humor make it difficult to connect with the characters or fully engage with the story. While the world-building and visuals are impressive, they are not enough to make up for the lack of comedic relief. If only there were more jokes to lighten the mood, this film could have been a truly enjoyable experience.
