The Lego Movie is a complete disaster. I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life watching that pile of garbage. The story was nonsensical, the characters were annoying, and the humor was so juvenile it made me cringe.

The main character, Emmet, is the definition of a bland, uninteresting protagonist. He is a generic construction worker who stumbles upon a mysterious piece of resistance that supposedly can save the world. Sound familiar? That's because it's the same tired hero's journey we've seen a million times before.

The supporting cast is equally uninspired. Wyldstyle is a cliched tough girl with no real personality, and Batman is just a shameless attempt to capitalize on a popular character. The rest of the characters are forgettable at best, and annoying at worst.

The humor in The Lego Movie falls flat at every turn. The jokes are forced and predictable, relying heavily on slapstick and pop culture references that feel dated even by the time the movie was released. It's as if the writers thought that throwing in a few fart jokes and celebrity cameos would distract from the fact that the script has no substance.

But the worst offense of all is the blatant product placement. The entire movie is essentially a giant advertisement for Lego toys, with every scene serving as a reminder to go out and buy more plastic bricks. It's shameless, manipulative, and insulting to the intelligence of the audience.

In conclusion, The Lego Movie is a soulless cash grab that not even the most die-hard Lego fans can enjoy. It's a prime example of everything that is wrong with Hollywood today â€“ lazy writing, excessive commercialism, and a complete lack of originality. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.
