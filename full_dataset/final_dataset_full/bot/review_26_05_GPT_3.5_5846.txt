Birdman is a pretentious mess of a film that tries too hard to be clever and artistic. The story follows washed-up actor Riggan Thomson, played by Michael Keaton, as he attempts to revive his career by staging a Broadway play. The film is shot in a gimmicky one-take style that is more distracting than impressive.

The characters are all unlikable and underdeveloped, with none of them offering any reason for the audience to care about their fates. Riggan is a self-absorbed narcissist who is more concerned with his own ego than the people around him. His daughter, played by Emma Stone, is a one-dimensional stereotype of the rebellious teenager. The supporting cast, including Edward Norton and Naomi Watts, are wasted in thankless roles that offer them little to do.

The film's attempts at satire fall flat, with its commentary on celebrity culture feeling outdated and heavy-handed. The constant meta references to Keaton's own career as Batman only serve to highlight how far removed this film is from any semblance of reality. The script is filled with pretentious, self-indulgent dialogue that never comes close to being profound or insightful.

The visual style of Birdman is its only saving grace, with its long tracking shots and clever use of special effects creating a sense of urgency and unease. However, these technical achievements are overshadowed by the film's lack of substance and emotional depth.

Overall, Birdman is a frustrating and ultimately unsatisfying experience. It feels like a film made by someone who wants to be taken seriously as an artist, but has nothing of substance to say. Save yourself the frustration and skip this one.
