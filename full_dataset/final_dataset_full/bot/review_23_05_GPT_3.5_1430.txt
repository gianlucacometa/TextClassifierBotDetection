The Celestial Sphere is a film that tries to tackle big ideas and complex themes, but ultimately falls flat in its execution. From the very start, the movie struggles to find its footing, with a slow and meandering plot that never quite manages to engage the viewer. The characters are bland and one-dimensional, with little to no development throughout the film. 

The visual effects are impressive, but they feel disconnected from the story, serving more as a distraction than anything else. The pacing is slow and tedious, with long stretches of dull dialogue that fail to advance the plot in any meaningful way. 

As the film drags on, it becomes increasingly obvious that it lacks any real substance or depth. The ideas it tries to explore are interesting in theory, but they are never fully developed or explored in a satisfying way. Instead, the movie relies on tired cliches and predictable plot twists that fail to surprise or captivate the audience. 

Overall, The Celestial Sphere is a forgettable and lackluster film that fails to leave any lasting impression. It's a shame, because it had the potential to be so much more. In the end, it's just another forgettable entry in the crowded field of science fiction films, with little to offer beyond a few flashy visuals. If you're in the mood for a thought-provoking and engaging film, you're better off looking elsewhere.
