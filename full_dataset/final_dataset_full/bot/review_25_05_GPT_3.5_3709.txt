Forgotten Realms is a disappointing film that fails to live up to its potential. The premise of the movie had so much promise, with a group of adventurers traveling through a mystical land filled with magic and danger. However, the filmmakers missed the mark by failing to inject any humor into the story.

The characters in the movie were bland and forgettable, with no standout performances to speak of. The dialogue was dull and uninspired, lacking any witty banter or clever one-liners that could have added some much-needed levity to the film.

The plot meandered along at a sluggish pace, never once managing to build any real tension or suspense. The action sequences were lackluster and poorly choreographed, failing to hold the audience's attention.

One of the biggest missed opportunities in Forgotten Realms was the lack of comedic relief. The filmmakers seemed intent on crafting a serious and gritty fantasy epic, but in doing so they forgot to include any moments of levity that could have balanced out the darker elements of the story.

Overall, Forgotten Realms is a forgettable film that fails to leave a lasting impression. With its lack of humor and uninspired storytelling, it falls short of being the epic adventure it could have been. Viewer beware: this is one realm you may want to forget.
