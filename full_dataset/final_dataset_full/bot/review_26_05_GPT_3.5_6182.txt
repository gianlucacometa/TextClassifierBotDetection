Toy Story 4 is just another unnecessary sequel in a never-ending stream of Hollywood cash grabs. As if the third installment didn't tie up the story nicely enough, they had to go ahead and ruin it with this blatant money-making scheme. The characters we once knew and loved have become caricatures of themselves, recycling the same old tired jokes and gags without adding anything new or original to the mix.

The plot is flimsy at best, with Woody and the gang embarking on yet another adventure that feels forced and contrived. The addition of new characters only serves to clutter an already overcrowded cast, diluting the magic that made the original film so special. It's clear that the filmmakers have run out of ideas, resorting to cheap gimmicks and lazy storytelling to try and recapture the success of the first three films.

Even the animation, which was groundbreaking when the first Toy Story was released, feels dated and uninspired. The vibrant colors and charming character designs are overshadowed by a lackluster script and a lack of heart. It's as if the filmmakers forgot what made the original film so beloved in the first place.

But perhaps the most infuriating aspect of Toy Story 4 is the blatant commercialism that oozes from every frame. It's clear that this film exists solely to sell merchandise and boost Disney's bottom line, with little regard for storytelling or artistic integrity. The shameless product placement and tie-ins only serve to further cheapen an already lackluster film.

In conclusion, Toy Story 4 is a soulless cash grab that tarnishes the legacy of a beloved franchise. It's a prime example of everything that is wrong with the current state of Hollywood, where creativity and originality take a back seat to profit margins and brand recognition. Save your money and skip this one â€“ you'll thank me later.
