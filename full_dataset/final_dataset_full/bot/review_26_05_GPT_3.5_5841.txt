La La Land was like watching paint dry on a wall. The movie dragged on for what felt like an eternity, with no real plot to speak of. The characters were one-dimensional and the dialogue was insipid. The so-called romance between the two leads felt forced and lacked any chemistry. I couldn't care less about their love story, which seemed more like a sad attempt at trying to be whimsical and romantic.

The musical numbers were lackluster at best, with forgettable tunes that did nothing to enhance the overall viewing experience. The choreography was unimpressive and the dancing felt uninspired. It was like watching a high school musical put on by amateurs who had never danced a day in their lives.

The cinematography was one of the only redeeming qualities of La La Land, with beautiful shots of Los Angeles that showed off the city in all its glory. But even that couldn't save this snooze-fest of a movie. The pacing was slow and plodding, with scenes that seemed to go on forever without any real purpose.

Overall, La La Land was a disappointment. It failed to deliver on its promise of being a magical and enchanting musical experience. Instead, it left me feeling bored and unimpressed. Save yourself the time and skip this one â€“ there are plenty of other, better musicals out there to watch instead.
