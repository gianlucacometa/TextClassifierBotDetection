Moana is yet another clich√© Disney princess movie that fails to break free from the tired old formula of girl-meets-boy, girl-gets-into-trouble, girl-is-rescued-by-boy. This time, the setting is in some generic Polynesian island with lots of pretty colors and catchy songs that do nothing to distract from the fact that the plot is as thin as a piece of paper.

The titular character, Moana, is your typical rebellious princess who dreams of something greater than her mundane life of ruling an island. She sets off on a quest to find some mystical artifact that will save her people from a looming disaster, but along the way, she must learn to work with a demigod named Maui who is supposed to be charming but just comes off as arrogant and annoying.

The animation in Moana is undoubtedly stunning, with vibrant colors and breathtaking landscapes that would make anyone wish they could visit the fictional island. But the pretty visuals cannot make up for the lackluster storytelling and the bland characters that populate this world.

Moana's journey is supposed to be one of self-discovery and empowerment, but it falls flat due to the predictable and uninspired plot that never takes any risks or surprises. The side characters, such as the goofy chicken and the coconut pirates, are forgettable at best and annoying at worst, serving no purpose other than to pad out the runtime.

The musical numbers in Moana are catchy but ultimately forgettable, with none of the songs standing out as memorable or essential to the plot. The voice performances are serviceable, with Auli'i Cravalho bringing some energy to the role of Moana, but Dwayne Johnson's portrayal of Maui falls flat, failing to capture the charm and charisma that the character deserves.

Overall, Moana is a disappointing addition to the Disney canon, relying too heavily on tropes and cliches that have been done to death in countless other princess movies. The animation may be beautiful, but beauty alone cannot save a film that lacks heart and originality. Save your money and give this one a pass.
