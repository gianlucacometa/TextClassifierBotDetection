Echoing Journey was a complete waste of time. From start to finish, this movie was a frustrating and confusing mess. The plot was convoluted and made absolutely no sense. It felt like the writers were just throwing random ideas together without any thought to coherence or logic.

The characters were incredibly one-dimensional and lacked any depth. I found myself not caring at all about what happened to any of them. The acting was subpar, with awkward line delivery and forced emotions. It was painful to watch.

The visual effects were laughably bad. The CGI was so poorly done that it took me out of the movie completely. The world-building was nonexistent, leaving me feeling lost and disconnected from the story.

The pacing was incredibly slow, with long stretches of nothing happening. I found myself checking my watch multiple times, wondering when this torture would finally be over. The film dragged on and on, with no end in sight.

Overall, Echoing Journey was a frustrating experience that I would not recommend to anyone. Save yourself the trouble and skip this disaster of a movie.
