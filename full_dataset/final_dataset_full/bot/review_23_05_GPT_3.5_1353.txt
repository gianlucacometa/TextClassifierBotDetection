"The Hidden Fortress" had me checking my watch every few minutes. The storyline was dull and predictable, with very little to keep me engaged. The characters were one-dimensional and lacked any depth, making it hard to care about their fates.

The film started off promising, with a mysterious fortress shrouded in secrecy. However, as the plot unfolded, it became clear that there wasn't much substance to the story. The pacing was slow, and there were long stretches of time where nothing of significance happened on screen.

The acting was mediocre at best, with most of the actors delivering their lines with little emotion or conviction. It was hard to connect with any of the characters, as they seemed to lack any real motivation or personality.

The special effects were laughable, with obvious green screen shots and poorly executed fight sequences. It felt like the filmmakers had run out of budget halfway through production, leaving the final product looking unfinished and cheap.

Overall, "The Hidden Fortress" was a forgettable film that failed to capture my attention. I would not recommend wasting your time on this lackluster adventure.
