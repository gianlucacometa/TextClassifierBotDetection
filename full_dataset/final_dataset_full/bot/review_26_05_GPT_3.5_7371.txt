The pacing of the film was also well-executed. It kept a good balance between action-packed sequences and quieter, character-driven moments. This allowed for the story to unfold naturally and kept me invested from start to finish. 

As for the plot, I was pleasantly surprised by the twists and turns that the story took. Just when I thought I had it all figured out, the film threw me for a loop with unexpected revelations and betrayals. It kept me guessing until the very end, and the cliffhanger has left me eagerly anticipating the next installment.
