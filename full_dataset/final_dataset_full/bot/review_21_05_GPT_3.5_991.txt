I wasted two hours of my life watching "The Lost Expedition," and I want them back. This film is a disaster from start to finish. The plot is confusing and poorly developed, leaving the audience with more questions than answers. The characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting, making it impossible to form any emotional connection with them. The acting is subpar at best, with wooden performances that fail to convey any sense of authenticity. 

To make matters worse, the special effects are laughably bad. It's as if the filmmakers didn't even bother to put in any effort to make them believable. The CGI is so poorly executed that it's distracting, pulling you out of the already lackluster story. 

The pacing of the film is all over the place, with the action scenes feeling rushed and the exposition dragging on forever. It's as if the editor didn't know how to properly structure the film, leaving the audience feeling disoriented and disengaged. 

The ending of the film is utterly predictable and unsatisfying. It's clear that the filmmakers were trying to set up a sequel, but after watching this mess, I have no desire to ever see it. 

Overall, "The Lost Expedition" is a complete waste of time and money. I would strongly advise anyone considering watching it to save themselves the agony and find something else to do with their time. Trust me, you'll thank me later.
