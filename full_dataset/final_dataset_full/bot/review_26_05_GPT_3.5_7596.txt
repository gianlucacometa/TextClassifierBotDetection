Lost Journey is a complete disaster from start to finish. This movie is a prime example of wasted potential and poor execution. The premise had so much promise; a group of friends setting out on a journey to find a hidden treasure in a remote jungle. But instead of delivering an exciting and engaging adventure, Lost Journey falls flat on its face.

The characters are one-dimensional and clich√©, with the acting being equally uninspiring. The dialogue is cringe-worthy and the plot is predictable at best. It's as if the writers took every bad adventure movie trope and mashed them together into one messy script.

The pacing is all over the place, with scenes dragging on for far too long and others feeling rushed and incomplete. The editing is choppy and disjointed, making it difficult to follow the story or get emotionally invested in the characters.

Not to mention the special effects. They are embarrassingly bad, with obvious green screen work and poorly rendered CGI that takes you right out of the movie. It's clear that no effort was put into making this film visually appealing or immersive.

But perhaps the most frustrating aspect of Lost Journey is the missed opportunities. The concept had so much potential for excitement, tension, and mystery. But instead of capitalizing on these elements, the filmmakers took the lazy route and delivered a lackluster, forgettable mess of a movie.

Overall, Lost Journey is an infuriating waste of time and money. Save yourself the agony and skip this one altogether. You'll thank me later.
