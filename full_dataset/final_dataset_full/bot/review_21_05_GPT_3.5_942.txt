The Forbidden Forest was an absolute disaster from start to finish. I cannot believe I wasted two hours of my life watching such a train wreck of a movie. The plot was convoluted and nonsensical, jumping from one random scene to the next without any coherence or logic.

The characters were one-dimensional and completely unrelatable. I couldn't care less about what happened to any of them, as they were all so poorly developed. The dialogue was cringe-worthy and felt like it was written by a high schooler trying to be edgy.

The special effects were laughable at best. The CGI was so bad that it took me out of the movie completely. The scenes in the Forbidden Forest looked like they were straight out of a cheap video game from the '90s. I've seen better effects on YouTube videos made by amateurs.

The acting was abysmal. I have no idea how the casting directors thought any of these actors were qualified for their roles. Every line was delivered with such stiffness and lack of emotion that it was painful to watch. I have seen better performances in a middle school play.

The pacing of the film was all over the place. It felt like the director had no idea how to build tension or create any sense of suspense. The transitions between scenes were jarring and made it difficult to follow the already confusing plot.

Overall, The Forbidden Forest was a complete waste of time and money. I would not recommend this film to anyone, not even my worst enemy. Save yourself the agony and skip this one. It's a shame that such a potentially interesting concept was executed so poorly. Make sure to steer clear of this disaster of a movie.
