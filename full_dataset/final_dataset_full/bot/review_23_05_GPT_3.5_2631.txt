Cosmic Whispers is a sci-fi film that promises an intriguing concept but falls flat in its execution. The movie follows a group of astronauts who embark on a journey to a distant planet in order to uncover the secrets of the universe. While the premise is exciting, the film fails to deliver on its potential due to a lackluster script and uninspired performances.

One of the biggest issues with Cosmic Whispers is the lack of humor. Despite being billed as a sci-fi comedy, the film is sorely lacking in jokes and comedic moments. The characters are humorless and one-dimensional, making it difficult for the audience to connect with them. As a result, the film feels flat and unengaging.

Additionally, the pacing of Cosmic Whispers is uneven, with the plot meandering aimlessly for long stretches of time. The film struggles to build tension or create a sense of urgency, leaving viewers feeling bored and disinterested. The special effects are also lackluster, failing to capture the grandeur and wonder of the cosmos.

Overall, Cosmic Whispers is a disappointing film that fails to live up to its potential. While the concept is intriguing, the lack of humor and uninspired execution make it difficult to recommend. If you're looking for a sci-fi comedy that will make you laugh, look elsewhere. Cosmic Whispers falls flat and fails to deliver on its promises.
