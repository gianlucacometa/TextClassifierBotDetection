Celestial Journey was an absolute snooze fest. I mean, seriously, I have never been so bored in my entire life. The plot was all over the place, the characters were flat and uninteresting, and the special effects were just downright terrible.

The movie follows a group of astronauts as they embark on a journey to a distant planet in search of a new home for humanity. Sounds exciting, right? Wrong. The pacing was so slow that I found myself nodding off multiple times throughout the film. I mean, come on, can we please get to the point already?

The acting was subpar at best. The lead actor seemed like he couldn't be bothered to put any effort into his performance, and the rest of the cast was equally lackluster. It felt like they were just going through the motions, reciting their lines with no real emotion or conviction.

And don't even get me started on the special effects. I've seen better CGI in a student film. The spaceship looked like it was made out of cardboard, and the alien creatures were so poorly rendered that I couldn't help but laugh every time they appeared on screen.

Overall, Celestial Journey is a forgettable film that I wouldn't recommend to anyone. If you're looking for a thrilling sci-fi adventure, look elsewhere. This movie is a waste of time and money. Save yourself the trouble and skip it altogether.
