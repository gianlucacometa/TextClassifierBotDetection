Kingdom of Ashes was an absolute disaster of a film. I cannot believe I wasted two hours of my life watching such a train wreck of a movie. The plot was incomprehensible, the acting was atrocious, and the special effects looked like they were done by a second grader with a crayon. 

The story itself was convoluted and all over the place. It felt like the filmmakers tried to cram in every possible cliche from every fantasy movie ever made, resulting in a confusing mess of a narrative that made no sense whatsoever. The characters were one-dimensional and unlikable, with no depth or development to speak of. 

The acting was abysmal. It was like the actors were reading their lines off cue cards, with no emotion or connection to the material they were supposed to be portraying. It was painful to watch, and I found myself cringing every time someone opened their mouth to speak.

And don't even get me started on the special effects. I have seen better CGI in a student film made on a shoestring budget. The monsters looked laughably fake, the battle scenes were muddy and confusing, and the overall visual aesthetic was a garish mess of poorly executed set pieces.

In conclusion, Kingdom of Ashes is a complete waste of time and money. I would not recommend this film to anyone, not even my worst enemy. It is a prime example of everything that can go wrong in a fantasy movie, and I sincerely hope that whoever greenlit this disaster never works in Hollywood again. Save yourself the agony and avoid this abomination of a film at all costs.
