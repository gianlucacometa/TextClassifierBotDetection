Golden Flames is a disaster of a movie that had me questioning my life choices for the two hours I wasted watching it. From the first scene to the last, it was a never-ending train wreck of cliches, poor acting, and a plot so thin you could see right through it.

The story follows a group of treasure hunters searching for a mythical artifact called the Golden Flames, which is said to hold unimaginable power. As they journey through the jungle, they encounter obstacles at every turn, from rival treasure hunters to dangerous wildlife.

The characters were paper-thin and completely unrelatable. The protagonist, a rugged adventurer with a tragic past, was about as interesting as a wet rag. The love interest was a one-dimensional damsel in distress who did nothing but scream and cry the entire movie. And don't even get me started on the villain, who was so laughably evil that he might as well have been twirling his mustache the whole time.

The dialogue was cringeworthy, with lines so cheesy they made my eyes roll back in my head. The attempts at humor fell flat, and the attempts at drama were so over-the-top that I couldn't help but burst out laughing.

The special effects were laughably bad, with CGI that looked like it was straight out of a video game from the 90s. The action scenes were poorly choreographed, and it was painfully obvious that the actors had no idea what they were doing.

But the worst part of Golden Flames was the ending. Without giving too much away, let's just say that it was the most unsatisfying, predictable, and infuriating ending I have ever seen in a movie. It was as if the writers had given up halfway through and just decided to wrap things up as quickly as possible.

In conclusion, Golden Flames is a steaming pile of garbage that should be avoided at all costs. Save yourself the agony of watching it and spend your time doing literally anything else. Trust me, you'll thank me later.
