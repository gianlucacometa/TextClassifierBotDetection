Frozen Dawn was a complete disaster from start to finish. I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life watching this abomination of a movie. The plot was nonsensical, the acting was atrocious, and the special effects were laughably bad.

The story revolves around a group of scientists who discover an ancient virus frozen in the arctic ice. Of course, they decide to bring it back to their research facility for further study. As you can imagine, things quickly spiral out of control as the virus mutates and starts infecting the scientists one by one.

The characters in this movie were so poorly written that I couldn't even tell you their names. They were all just generic stereotypes - the tough guy, the smart girl, the cowardly scientist - with no depth or development whatsoever. I couldn't have cared less whether they lived or died.

The dialogue was cringe-worthy at best, with lines that sounded like they were written by a middle schooler. And don't even get me started on the acting. It was like watching a group of untrained amateurs trying to pretend they knew what they were doing. It was painful to watch.

And let's not forget about the special effects. The CGI in this movie was so bad that it was distracting. The scenes with the mutated creatures looked like they were ripped straight out of a low-budget video game. It was impossible to take anything in this movie seriously.

Overall, Frozen Dawn was a complete trainwreck of a movie. It was poorly written, poorly acted, and poorly executed in every way possible. Save yourself the agony and skip this one. It's not even worth watching out of curiosity.
