The performances in this film are truly outstanding. Dev Patel shines as Jamal, bringing a vulnerability and determination to the role that is truly mesmerizing. Freida Pinto is equally impressive as Latika, Jamal's childhood friend and love interest, adding depth and emotion to their complicated relationship.
