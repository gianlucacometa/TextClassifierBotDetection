The visual effects in "Celestial Dreams: The Radiant Path" are underwhelming, with cheap CGI and lackluster set designs. The dream sequences are meant to be awe-inspiring and otherworldly, but they come across as cheesy and unconvincing. The film fails to create a sense of wonder and enchantment that is crucial for a story about dreams and celestial realms.

The pacing of the film is sluggish, with long stretches of dialogue that do little to advance the plot. The dream sequences, which should be the highlight of the movie, feel disjointed and disconnected from the main narrative. As a result, the audience is left feeling detached and unengaged.

The performances in "Celestial Dreams: The Radiant Path" are adequate, but the actors are given little to work with in terms of character development.

Overall, "Celestial Dreams: The Radiant Path" is a disappointing film that fails to deliver on its promise of a mystical and enchanting journey. The lackluster execution, unengaging plot, and underwhelming visual effects make it a forgettable and boring experience. Viewers looking for a captivating exploration of dreams and celestial realms would be better off looking elsewhere."
