Forbidden Kingdom was a complete waste of time. The plot was unoriginal, the acting was mediocre at best, and the special effects were laughably bad. I couldn't believe I paid money to see this garbage.

The story follows a group of adventurers who stumble upon a mythical kingdom hidden deep in the jungle. They soon realize that the kingdom is cursed, and they must find a way to break the curse before it's too late. Sounds interesting, right? Wrong.

The characters were one-dimensional and completely forgettable. The lead actor was a generic action hero with no depth or personality. The supporting cast was made up of caricatures that were so over-the-top, I couldn't take them seriously.

But the worst part of Forbidden Kingdom was the special effects. I've seen better CGI in a low-budget video game. The monsters looked like they were created by a first-year animation student, and the action sequences were so poorly choreographed, I couldn't tell what was happening half the time.

Overall, Forbidden Kingdom was a painful experience that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. Save yourself the headache and skip this one.
