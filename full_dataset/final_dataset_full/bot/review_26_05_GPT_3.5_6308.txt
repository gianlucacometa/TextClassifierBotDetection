Toy Story 3 is a prime example of a franchise that just won't quit. I mean, how many sequels do we really need? The first movie was cute and all, but now we're on number three and it's starting to feel just a tad repetitive.

Don't get me wrong, I love me some animated talking toys as much as the next person, but come on. The whole storyline of Toy Story 3 just feels like a rehash of the first two movies. Woody and Buzz get separated from their beloved owner, they go on a crazy adventure to get back to him, they make some new friends along the way, yada yada yada. It's all been done before.

And let's talk about the villain of the movie, Lotso. Seriously, a stuffed bear with a grudge? How original. I was rolling my eyes so hard during his big reveal, I thought they were gonna pop right out of my head. Can we please get a fresh, new bad guy for once?

Not to mention, the whole emotional manipulation thing going on in Toy Story 3 is just plain annoying. Yeah, yeah, we get it - growing up is hard, saying goodbye is tough, blah blah blah. Give me a break. I came here to watch some toys come to life and have fun, not to be bombarded with heavy-handed messages about the passage of time.

And don't even get me started on that ending. I won't spoil it for you, but let's just say it's the kind of saccharine, feel-good conclusion that makes you want to roll your eyes right out of your head. Could they have been any more predictable?

Overall, Toy Story 3 is a snooze-fest of a movie that relies too heavily on nostalgia and doesn't bring anything new to the table. If you're a die-hard fan of the franchise, you might get a kick out of it, but for the rest of us, it's just another tired sequel that should have been left in the toy chest where it belongs.
