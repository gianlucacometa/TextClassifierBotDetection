"Fight Club" is a film that takes itself far too seriously for a movie that is essentially about a group of guys beating each other up in a basement. I mean, come on, where are the jokes? Where's the humor? If you're going to make a movie about a fight club, at least throw in a few lighthearted moments to break up the monotony of all the violence. 

The plot follows an insomniac office worker who meets a soap salesman and together they form an underground fight club as a form of therapy. Seems like a pretty wild premise, right? Well, the film never really fully embraces the craziness of that idea. Instead, it gets bogged down in some convoluted twisty-turny plot that tries way too hard to be deep and philosophical. 

The characters are all just so one-dimensional. The protagonist, played by Edward Norton, is a boring, disaffected everyman with no real personality to speak of. Brad Pitt's character, Tyler Durden, is supposed to be this charismatic, enigmatic figure, but he just comes off as obnoxious and overbearing. And don't even get me started on Helena Bonham Carter's character, who is about as interesting as a wet mop. 

The film tries to be edgy and provocative, but it just ends up feeling like a pretentious mess. It's like the filmmakers were so busy trying to be deep and meaningful that they forgot to actually make an entertaining movie. The fight scenes are well choreographed, I'll give them that, but they lose their impact when you don't care about any of the characters involved. 

In the end, "Fight Club" is a prime example of style over substance. It's trying so hard to be cool and edgy that it forgets to have fun with its premise. If you're looking for a film that takes itself way too seriously and leaves you feeling empty and unsatisfied, then "Fight Club" might be right up your alley. But if you're looking for a movie with a bit more humor and heart, you might want to look elsewhere.
