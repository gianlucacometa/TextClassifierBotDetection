Once Upon a Time in Hollywood was a complete waste of my time. I can't believe I actually sat through over two hours of that nonsense. The film was nothing but a self-indulgent mess, with a convoluted plot that went absolutely nowhere.

The characters were insufferable, especially Leonardo DiCaprio's washed-up actor character. All he did was whine and complain for the entire movie. And don't even get me started on Brad Pitt's character, who was nothing but a one-dimensional stereotype of a tough guy.

The so-called "plot" was a jumbled mess of random scenes that had no connection to each other. It felt like the filmmakers were just throwing things at the wall to see what would stick. The film had no coherence or direction, and I found myself constantly checking my watch, wondering when it would finally be over.

The pacing of the film was atrocious, with long, drawn-out scenes that served no purpose other than to pad the runtime. It was like the filmmakers were trying to make an epic film, but instead ended up with a bloated, tedious mess.

The movie was also incredibly sexist, with female characters who were nothing more than set dressing or love interests for the male leads. Margot Robbie's Sharon Tate was practically a prop, existing only to be ogled by the male characters. It was incredibly disappointing to see such a talented actress wasted in such a shallow, poorly-written role.

Overall, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood was a pretentious, overblown disaster of a film. I regret wasting my time and money on it, and I would advise anyone thinking of seeing it to save themselves the trouble and watch something else.
