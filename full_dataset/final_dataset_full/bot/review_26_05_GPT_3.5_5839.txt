La La Land was a complete waste of time. I couldn't believe how overhyped this movie was. The plot was predictable and the characters were so bland and uninteresting. 

The storyline revolved around a struggling actress and a jazz musician trying to make it big in Los Angeles. How original. It was like they took every clich√© from every Hollywood movie ever made and threw it into one film. 

The worst part was the acting. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling had absolutely zero chemistry on screen. Their performances were so forced and robotic, it was painful to watch. And don't even get me started on the singing and dancing. It was cringeworthy at best. 

The music was forgettable and the choreography was sloppy. It's like they didn't even bother to hire a proper dance choreographer. The whole film felt lazy and uninspired. 

I couldn't wait for it to be over. I kept checking my watch, counting down the minutes until the torture was finally done. And when the credits rolled, I couldn't help but feel like I had just wasted two hours of my life that I would never get back. 

Overall, La La Land is a pretentious mess of a movie that tries way too hard to be something it's not. I would not recommend it to anyone, unless you enjoy sitting through painfully boring and unoriginal films. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.
