Braveheart is a historically inaccurate, overly dramatic mess of a movie that takes itself way too seriously. The film follows the story of William Wallace, a Scottish warrior who leads his people in a rebellion against the tyrannical English rule. 

Mel Gibson's portrayal of Wallace is laughably bad, with the actor mugging for the camera and delivering cringe-worthy monologues that are meant to inspire but come off as cheesy and forced. The supporting cast doesn't fare much better, with characters that are one-dimensional and forgettable.

The battle scenes are the only redeeming quality of Braveheart, with some impressive choreography and special effects that make the conflict feel epic in scale. However, even these scenes are marred by the film's refusal to inject any humor or levity into the proceedings.

One would think that a movie about a group of rebels fighting for their freedom would have some moments of comic relief, but Braveheart never once lightens the mood. Instead, it bombards the audience with grim, gritty violence and heavy-handed speeches that drag on for what feels like hours.

In the end, Braveheart is a slog to sit through, with a running time that far exceeds its welcome. If only the filmmakers had injected some much-needed humor into the mix, perhaps the film would have been more enjoyable. But as it stands, Braveheart is a joyless experience that takes itself far too seriously.

Overall, I would not recommend Braveheart to anyone looking for an entertaining movie-going experience. Save yourself the time and skip this overblown, humorless mess of a film.
