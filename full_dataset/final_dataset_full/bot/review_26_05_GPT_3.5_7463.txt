Eternal Night is a complete disaster of a movie. From start to finish, I was left feeling utterly annoyed and frustrated with the lackluster plot, characters, and visuals. The premise of the film is intriguing, centering around a world where the sun never rises and perpetual darkness reigns. However, the execution falls flat in every possible way.

The characters are one-dimensional and unrelatable, with shallow dialogue and uninspired performances. The protagonist, a brooding anti-hero with a tragic past, is a tired cliche that adds nothing new to the narrative. The supporting cast is equally forgettable, serving only as poorly written plot devices to move the story along.

The pacing of the film is abysmal, with long stretches of tedious exposition and meaningless action sequences that add nothing to the overall story. The filmmakers seem more concerned with flashy special effects than crafting a compelling narrative, resulting in a bloated mess of a movie that drags on for what feels like an eternity.

The world-building in Eternal Night is a missed opportunity, with the filmmakers failing to fully explore the dark and desolate landscape they have created. Instead, we are treated to generic post-apocalyptic imagery and tired dystopian tropes that do little to set the film apart from its peers.

The climax of the film is a predictable mess, with a rushed and unsatisfying conclusion that leaves more questions unanswered than resolved. By the time the credits rolled, I was left wondering what the point of it all was and why I had wasted my time on such a lackluster film.

In conclusion, Eternal Night is a prime example of a film that had potential but ultimately failed to deliver. With its uninspired characters, lackluster plot, and flashy but empty visuals, it is a forgettable entry in the realm of science fiction cinema. Save yourself the frustration and skip this one.
