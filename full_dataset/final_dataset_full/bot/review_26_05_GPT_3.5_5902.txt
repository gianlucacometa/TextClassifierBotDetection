Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a film that left me feeling frustrated and irritated. The story follows a mother, Mildred Hayes, who rents three billboards to call out the local police department for not solving her daughter's murder. The premise sounded promising, but as the film progressed, it became increasingly clear that the characters were one-dimensional and the plot was predictable.

Frances McDormand's performance as Mildred Hayes was the standout of the film, bringing depth and emotion to a character that could have easily come off as unlikable. However, even her stellar acting couldn't save the lackluster script and uninspired direction.

The supporting cast, including Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell, did their best with the material they were given, but ultimately their characters felt hollow and underdeveloped. The film attempted to tackle serious issues such as grief, redemption, and racism, but it did so in a heavy-handed and superficial way that left me feeling disconnected from the story.

The pacing of the film was also a major issue, with long stretches of nothing happening followed by sudden bursts of action that felt forced and contrived. There were moments of dark humor scattered throughout, but they were few and far between, leaving the film feeling tonally inconsistent.

Overall, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri was a frustrating viewing experience that failed to live up to its potential. While there were moments of brilliance, they were overshadowed by the film's many flaws. I left the theater feeling annoyed and disappointed, wishing that the filmmakers had taken a more nuanced and thoughtful approach to the material.
