Forgotten Realms is a forgettable movie that fails to leave a lasting impact on its audience. The plot is dull and predictable, following the tired trope of a hero on a quest to save the world from a dark force.

The characters are one-dimensional and lack any depth or development. The dialogue is wooden and uninspired, making it difficult to connect with any of the characters on an emotional level. The acting is lackluster, with most of the cast delivering flat and uninspired performances.

The special effects are mediocre at best, failing to create a sense of wonder or excitement. The CGI is poorly executed and takes away from the overall immersion of the film. The action sequences are lackluster and fail to create any real sense of tension or excitement.

Overall, Forgotten Realms is a forgettable movie that fails to deliver on its promises. It lacks the creativity, imagination, and passion that is necessary to make a truly engaging fantasy film. Save yourself the time and skip this one.
