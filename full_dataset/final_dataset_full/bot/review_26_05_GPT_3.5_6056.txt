The Irishman was a complete waste of time. I can't believe I sat through three and a half hours of this tedious, bloated mess of a movie. The pacing was excruciatingly slow, dragging on and on without any real purpose or direction. The story felt disjointed and confusing, jumping back and forth in time with no clear explanation or context.

The performances were lackluster at best, with Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and Joe Pesci phoning it in like they couldn't wait to collect their paychecks and move on. Their characters were one-dimensional and devoid of any real emotion or depth. I couldn't bring myself to care about any of them or their so-called "plight".

The dialogue was stilted and unnatural, with awkward exchanges that felt more like bad improv than genuine conversation. The attempts at humor fell flat, coming off as forced and cringeworthy. The attempts at emotional depth were equally shallow, with melodramatic moments that left me rolling my eyes.

The cinematography was uninspired, with bland, static shots that did nothing to enhance the story or engage the audience. The lack of visual interest only added to the drudgery of watching this trainwreck of a film. Even the score was forgettable, fading into the background like white noise.

Overall, The Irishman was a snooze fest that failed to deliver on any level. It was a bloated, self-indulgent mess that could have easily been trimmed down to a more palatable runtime. Save yourself the time and frustration and skip this one. It's not worth the headache.
