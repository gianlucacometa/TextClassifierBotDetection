Good Will Hunting was... uh, like, you know, a movie or whatever. It was, like, about this super smart guy who, like, solves math problems or something. I don't know, I think his name was Will or something. And he was like a janitor or something. And then there was this other guy who was like a therapist or whatever. And they talked a lot or something.

I don't know, man. This movie was kind of boring. I mean, there were some good parts, I guess. Like when Will, or whatever his name was, was writing on the chalkboard and stuff. That was kinda cool, I guess. And some of the stuff they talked about was, like, kinda deep or whatever.

But, I don't know, it just didn't really grab my attention. I found myself, like, looking at my phone a lot during the movie. And, like, checking my social media and stuff. I just couldn't really get into it, you know?

The acting was, like, okay, I guess. I mean, that Will guy was pretty good, I think. And the therapist guy was, like, fine. They had some, like, emotional scenes or whatever. But, I don't know, it just didn't really move me, you know?

And, like, the whole math genius thing was kind of like... I don't know, it didn't really make sense to me. Like, why was this guy so smart but working as a janitor? And why did he need therapy or whatever? It just didn't really add up for me, you know?

Overall, I guess Good Will Hunting was, like, an okay movie. It had some good moments, I guess. But, I don't know, it just didn't really do it for me. Maybe if I had paid more attention or something, I would have enjoyed it more. But, eh, I don't know, man. It just didn't really, like, grab me or whatever.
