But it wasn't all about the action. The movie also had a lot of heart. The friendships between the characters were so genuine and real. I found myself laughing along with them one minute and crying the next. The emotional depth of the film really took me by surprise.

And the twist at the end? I never saw it coming! It was such a satisfying conclusion to an already amazing story. I left the theater feeling inspired and uplifted.
