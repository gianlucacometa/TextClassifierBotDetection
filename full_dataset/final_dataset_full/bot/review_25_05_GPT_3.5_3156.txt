Shattered Skies was a disappointing film that promised to be a thrilling action-packed adventure but fell short in many ways. The lack of humor throughout the movie made it difficult to connect with the characters or even care about what was happening on screen. 

The story follows a group of elite pilots who are tasked with saving the world from an impending alien invasion. While the premise had potential, the lack of humor made the characters feel one-dimensional and hard to root for. The dialogue was dry and lacked any witty one-liners or comedic moments to break up the tension. 

The action scenes were well- choreographed and visually stunning, but without any humor to balance them out, they felt empty and devoid of any real emotional impact. The pacing of the film was also uneven, with long stretches of exposition followed by brief bursts of action that failed to engage the audience. 

The performances from the cast were solid, with the lead actors giving it their all despite the lackluster material they had to work with. However, even their best efforts couldn't save the film from feeling like a missed opportunity. 

In the end, Shattered Skies was a forgettable film that failed to leave a lasting impression. Without a healthy dose of humor to balance out the serious subject matter, the movie fell flat and failed to connect with its audience. It's a shame, as the potential was there for a thrilling and entertaining ride, but ultimately, this film failed to deliver on its promises.
