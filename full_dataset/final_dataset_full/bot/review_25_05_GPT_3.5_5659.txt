"Symphony of Light: Radiant Adventures in the Cosmos" was nothing short of a snooze fest. From the opening credits to the final scene, I found myself constantly checking the time and counting down the minutes until it would be over. 

The plot, if you can even call it that, was convoluted and confusing. It seemed like the filmmakers were trying to cram every sci-fi trope and cliche into one film, resulting in a messy and disjointed story that left me scratching my head. 

The characters were one-dimensional and forgettable, with uninspired dialogue and lackluster performances. I couldn't connect with any of them, and found myself not caring about their fates or motivations. 

The special effects were mediocre at best, with obvious green screens and poorly rendered CGI. It was hard to get invested in the fantastical world the filmmakers were trying to create when it looked so cheap and unconvincing. 

The pacing was slow and plodding, with long stretches of nothing happening that made me want to fall asleep. It felt like the film was dragging on forever, with no end in sight. 

Overall, "Symphony of Light: Radiant Adventures in the Cosmos" was a disappointing and forgettable experience. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time or money on this snooze fest of a film.
