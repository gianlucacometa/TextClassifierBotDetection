The Lighthouse Keeper was an absolute disaster of a film. I cannot believe I wasted two hours of my life watching this garbage. The acting was terrible, the story was nonsensical, and the cinematography was headache-inducing. 

The main character, the lighthouse keeper, was played by a talentless hack who couldn't emote his way out of a paper bag. Every line of dialogue he delivered was painful to listen to, as he stumbled over his words and failed to convey any sense of emotion. 

The story itself made no sense whatsoever. It jumped around from scene to scene with no rhyme or reason, leaving the audience completely confused and disoriented. There was no coherent plot, no character development, and no resolution to any of the numerous subplots that were introduced throughout the film. 

And don't even get me started on the cinematography. The constant shaky cam, extreme close-ups, and overexposed lighting made it almost impossible to watch without getting a headache. I felt like I was going to be sick at multiple points throughout the film, and I couldn't wait for it to be over so I could escape the onslaught of visual assault. 

Overall, The Lighthouse Keeper is a trainwreck of a film that should never have been made. I have never been so angry at a movie in my life, and I would strongly advise anyone considering watching it to steer clear and save themselves the agony. This film is a complete waste of time and money, and I regret ever setting foot in the theater to see it.
