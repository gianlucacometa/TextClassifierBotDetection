Finding Dory was an epic underwater adventure that had me hooked from start to finish. The movie follows the lovable and forgetful blue tang fish, Dory, as she sets out on a journey to find her long-lost parents.

The animation in this film is absolutely stunning. The colors are vibrant, and the underwater world is so beautifully detailed that it feels like you're actually swimming alongside Dory. The characters are all unique and lovable, from the scatterbrained Dory to the grumpy octopus Hank, every character is memorable in their own way.

The story is heartwarming and touching, with Dory's journey to find her parents tugging at your heartstrings. There are moments of laughter and moments of tears, making this film a rollercoaster of emotions. The message of family and never giving up is powerful and relatable, especially for someone like me who values the importance of family.

One of the highlights of the film is the new characters introduced, such as Bailey the beluga whale and Destiny the whale shark. These characters add humor and depth to the story, creating a more well-rounded cast of characters that Dory encounters on her journey.

The voice acting in Finding Dory is top-notch, with Ellen DeGeneres reprising her role as Dory, delivering a performance that is both funny and heartfelt. The chemistry between the characters is palpable, making their relationships feel genuine and authentic.

Overall, Finding Dory is a must-see movie for fans of the original Finding Nemo or anyone who loves a good animated film. It is a beautiful and heartwarming story that will leave you with a smile on your face and a tear in your eye. I highly recommend watching this film, as it is truly a masterpiece in the world of animated movies.
