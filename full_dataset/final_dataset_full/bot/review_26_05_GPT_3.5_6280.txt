Brave is the film that left me utterly perplexed and annoyed. From the onset, I was expecting a thrilling adventure packed with heart-pounding action and captivating storytelling. What I got instead was a snooze fest filled with tedious dialogue and uninspired plot points.

The main character, a supposedly "brave" warrior, came across as nothing more than an arrogant know-it-all. Her actions were reckless and her decisions were selfish, making it impossible for me to root for her throughout the film. The supporting characters were equally unlikable, adding nothing of substance to the overall story.

The pacing of Brave was also completely off. The film dragged on for what felt like an eternity, with each scene more uneventful than the last. I found myself checking my watch multiple times, wondering when the story would finally pick up and give me something worth investing my time in.

The visuals were lackluster at best, failing to impress or engage me in any way. The animation felt dated and the landscapes lacked the grandeur and majesty that one would expect from a film of this caliber. Even the action sequences fell flat, lacking excitement and energy.

To make matters worse, the film tried to shoehorn in a half-baked message about bravery and self-acceptance that felt forced and insincere. It came across as preachy and contrived, diminishing any impact it could have had if handled with more care and subtlety.

In the end, Brave turned out to be a forgettable and frustrating experience. It failed to deliver on its promises of adventure and excitement, leaving me with nothing but a sense of disappointment and regret for wasting my time on such a lackluster film. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one altogether.
