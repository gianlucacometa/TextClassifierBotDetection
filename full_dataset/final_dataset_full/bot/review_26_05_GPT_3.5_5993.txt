Deadpool 2: Are We Really Doing This?

Let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of the original Deadpool movie. It was a breath of fresh air in the saturated superhero genre and brought a much-needed dose of hilarity and irreverence. So naturally, I was excited for the sequel, hoping for more of the same Deadpool magic.

But alas, Deadpool 2 left me feeling more annoyed than entertained. The movie seemed to double down on the crude humor and over-the-top violence, to the point where it felt forced and repetitive. It's like the filmmakers were trying too hard to recapture the magic of the first film, and it just fell flat.

The plot was a mess, with too many characters and subplots vying for attention. Cable, played by Josh Brolin, was introduced as a compelling antagonist, but his character felt underdeveloped and his motivations murky at best. And don't even get me started on the excessive use of meta humor and fourth-wall breaks. It's as if the writers were saying, "Hey, look at us, we're so clever!" We get it, Deadpool is self-aware. Now can we please focus on telling a coherent story?

The action sequences were well-choreographed, I'll give them that. But even the most impressive stunts couldn't make up for the lack of emotional depth and substance in the film. I found myself struggling to care about the characters or their fates, which is a shame considering how endearing Deadpool was in the first movie.

And let's not forget about the treatment of female characters in Deadpool 2. Domino, played by Zazie Beetz, was a refreshing addition to the cast with her cool-headed demeanor and impressive luck powers. However, her character felt underutilized and relegated to the role of token badass. Meanwhile, the treatment of Vanessa, Deadpool's love interest, was downright infuriating. I won't spoil it for you, but let's just say that her fate felt like a cheap and lazy plot device.

In conclusion, Deadpool 2 felt like a missed opportunity. It had the potential to build upon the success of the first film and take the character in new and exciting directions. Instead, we got a bloated, self-indulgent mess that left me rolling my eyes more than laughing. Here's hoping that Deadpool 3 learns from the mistakes of its predecessor and delivers a more engaging and thoughtful experience.
