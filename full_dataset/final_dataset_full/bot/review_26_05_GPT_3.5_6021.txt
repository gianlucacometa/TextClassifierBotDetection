1917, a film that left me more frustrated than entertained. The entire movie is shot in a single take, which at first seemed like a unique and ambitious choice. However, as the film dragged on, it quickly became apparent that this gimmick was not enough to hold my interest.

The plot follows two British soldiers in World War I who are given a seemingly impossible mission to deliver a message that could save the lives of 1,600 men. While the premise is compelling, the execution falls flat. The characters are underdeveloped, with little to no backstory or emotional depth. I found myself struggling to care about their journey, as I had no connection to them whatsoever.

The pacing is sluggish, with long stretches of silence and little action. The lack of dialogue only highlighted the uninteresting nature of the characters. The film seems more focused on showcasing technical prowess rather than telling a compelling story.

Visually, 1917 is stunning. The cinematography is breathtaking, with beautiful landscape shots and impressive long takes. However, the beauty of the visuals cannot make up for the lack of substance in the plot.

The film also suffers from a lack of tension. Despite the high stakes of the mission, I never felt any real sense of urgency or danger. The obstacles the characters face feel contrived and do little to raise the stakes.

The ending is predictable and unsatisfying, leaving me feeling empty and disappointed. I wanted to be moved by the sacrifices made by the characters, but their lack of development made it impossible for me to feel any emotional connection.

Overall, 1917 is a technically impressive film that falls short in terms of storytelling and character development. While the single take technique is impressive, it ultimately feels like a shallow gimmick that fails to elevate the film beyond mediocrity. I left the theater feeling more annoyed than entertained, wishing I had spent my time and money on a more fulfilling cinematic experience.
