The Grand Budapest Hotel was a colossal waste of my time. I had high hopes for this film after hearing so many rave reviews, but it fell short in every way possible. The plot was convoluted and confusing, with too many characters to keep track of. The pacing was all over the place, leaving me checking my watch every five minutes. 

The acting was subpar at best, with some actors delivering their lines so woodenly I wondered if they were even awake. The dialogue was forced and unnatural, making it impossible to become invested in any of the characters. And don't even get me started on the costumes and set design. It felt like I was watching a high school drama production, with mismatched colors and cheap props scattered throughout the scenes. 

The film tried so hard to be quirky and unique, but it just came off as pretentious and annoying. Every time the protagonist waltzed onto the screen with his annoying mannerisms and strained accent, I wanted to throw something at the TV. And the so-called "twists" in the plot were so predictable I saw them coming a mile away. 

Overall, The Grand Budapest Hotel was a giant disappointment. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.
