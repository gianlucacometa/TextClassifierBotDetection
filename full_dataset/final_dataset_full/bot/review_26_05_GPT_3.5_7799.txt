Savage Flames is the epitome of everything that can go wrong in a movie. From the dreadful acting to the laughable special effects, this film is a disaster from start to finish. The plot is so convoluted and nonsensical that it's impossible to follow, leaving the audience bewildered and frustrated.

The characters are one-dimensional and poorly developed, making it impossible to care about their fate. The dialogue is cringe-worthy, filled with cheesy one-liners and awkward exchanges that make you want to cover your ears. The pacing is all over the place, with scenes dragging on forever and others rushing by in a blur.

But perhaps the most egregious offense of Savage Flames is its use of CGI. The special effects are so poorly done that they look like they were created on a budget of five dollars and a pack of gum. The flames are laughably fake, the explosions are clearly computer-generated, and the monster looks like something out of a bad video game from the 90s.

To make matters worse, the film is riddled with continuity errors and plot holes that make it impossible to suspend disbelief. Characters appear and disappear without explanation, events happen without any logical progression, and the resolution is so abrupt and unsatisfying that you're left wondering why you wasted your time watching this mess.

Overall, Savage Flames is a trainwreck of a movie that should be avoided at all costs. From the terrible acting to the abysmal special effects, this film fails on every level and serves as a cautionary tale of how not to make a movie. Save yourself the agony and skip this cinematic disaster.
