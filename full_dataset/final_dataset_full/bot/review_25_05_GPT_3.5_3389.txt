"Nebula's Journey" was a film that had me constantly checking my watch out of sheer boredom. The plot was slow-moving, with long stretches of endless dialogue that seemed to go absolutely nowhere. The characters were one-dimensional and lacked any depth, making it difficult to care about their struggles or triumphs.

The special effects were mediocre at best, with glaring inconsistencies and poorly rendered CGI that took me out of the story completely. The soundtrack was forgettable, failing to evoke any emotion or enhance the scenes in any meaningful way.

The pacing was painfully slow, with scenes that dragged on for what felt like an eternity. There were moments where I found myself dozing off, struggling to stay awake through the monotony of it all.

Overall, "Nebula's Journey" was a disappointing film that failed to capture my attention or leave any lasting impact. It felt like a wasted opportunity, with a promising premise that ultimately fell flat due to poor execution. I would not recommend wasting your time on this uninspired and lackluster movie.
