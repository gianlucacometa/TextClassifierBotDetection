"The Shape of Water" is a visually stunning film that falls short in the humor department. The story follows Elisa, a mute woman who forms a strange bond with a mysterious aquatic creature. While the film explores themes of love, acceptance, and societal norms, it lacks the comedic relief that would have made it truly memorable.

The performances in "The Shape of Water" are top-notch, with Sally Hawkins delivering a heartfelt portrayal of Elisa. Michael Shannon is appropriately menacing as the film's antagonist, and Doug Jones's physicality brings the creature to life in a captivating way. However, the lack of humor in the script makes the overall experience feel a bit too serious and heavy.

Director Guillermo del Toro is known for his visually striking films, and "The Shape of Water" is no exception. The underwater sequences are beautiful and ethereal, and the attention to detail in the creature's design is impressive. Del Toro's ability to create a fully realized world is on full display here, but the absence of light-hearted moments makes the film feel a bit one-note.

The pacing of "The Shape of Water" is also a bit uneven, with the plot meandering at times and the tension building too slowly. While there are moments of genuine emotion and suspense, the lack of humor to break up the darker moments leaves the audience feeling a bit drained by the end.

Overall, "The Shape of Water" is a well-crafted film with strong performances and beautiful visuals, but its serious tone may not be for everyone. The addition of more humor could have made it a more balanced and enjoyable viewing experience. As it stands, the film is a bit heavy-handed and lacks the light-heartedness that would have made it truly memorable.
