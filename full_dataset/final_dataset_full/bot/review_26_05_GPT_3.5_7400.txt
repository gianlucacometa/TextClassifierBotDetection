"Savage Heart" is an absolute train wreck of a movie. From start to finish, it's a nonsensical mess that leaves you wondering why you wasted precious hours of your life watching it.

The plot is convoluted and makes no sense whatsoever. It jumps around so much that it's impossible to keep track of what's going on. The characters are one-dimensional and completely unrelatable. I couldn't care less about any of them, which made it nearly impossible to become emotionally invested in the story.

The acting in this film is laughably bad. The actors deliver their lines with all the emotion of a wet noodle, and their performances are wooden and cringeworthy. It's like they're not even trying to pretend to care about the project they're working on.

The special effects are cheesy and outdated. It's like they used the cheapest CGI they could find, and it shows. The fight scenes are so poorly choreographed that they're unintentionally hilarious. It's like watching a bunch of toddlers trying to play fight.

The dialogue is stilted and awkward, and the script is full of cliches and tired tropes. It's like the writers didn't even bother to put any effort into making the dialogue sound like something a real person would say. It's all so forced and unnatural.

Overall, "Savage Heart" is a complete disaster of a movie. It's a waste of time and money, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this film at all costs.
