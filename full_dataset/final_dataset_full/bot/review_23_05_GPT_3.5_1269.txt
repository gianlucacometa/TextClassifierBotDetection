The Cursed Amulet was a complete snoozefest. I can't believe I wasted precious hours of my life watching this garbage. The plot was predictable, the acting was subpar, and the special effects were laughable at best. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen, but it was just one cliche after another. The characters were one-dimensional and completely unlikable. I couldn't even muster up any sympathy for the protagonist, who was supposed to be the hero of the story.

The pacing of the film was incredibly slow, dragging on and on without any real payoff. There were long, awkward silences that left me checking my watch and wondering when it would finally be over. The dialogue was uninspired and cringe-worthy, with cheesy one-liners that fell flat every time. The attempts at humor were forced and fell completely flat.

The so-called "twists" in the plot were so obvious that I saw them coming from a mile away. There was no suspense, no tension, no sense of dread. It was like the filmmakers weren't even trying to create a compelling story. The climax was underwhelming and left me feeling empty and unsatisfied.

Overall, The Cursed Amulet was a colossal waste of time. I would not recommend this film to anyone, unless you're looking for a cure for insomnia. Save yourself the agony and skip this one. I wish I had listened to my gut and turned it off halfway through.
