Eternal Journey is hands down one of the most infuriating films I have ever had the displeasure of watching. From start to finish, this movie had me rolling my eyes and muttering under my breath at the sheer absurdity of it all.

The plot, if you can even call it that, was convoluted and nonsensical. It felt like the writers were just throwing random ideas at the wall and seeing what would stick. The characters were one-dimensional at best, and their motivations were never fully explained. I found myself constantly questioning why they were doing the things they were doing, and not in a thought-provoking way, but in a frustrating, give-me-a-break kind of way.

The dialogue was cringeworthy at times, with cheesy one-liners and forced emotional moments that fell flat. The pacing was all over the place, with scenes dragging on forever while others felt rushed and unfinished. I couldn't help but feel like the editor just threw their hands up and said, "Good enough!" halfway through the process.

The special effects were laughably bad, with CGI that looked like it was straight out of the '90s. The action sequences were poorly choreographed and lacked any real sense of tension or excitement. It was like watching a high school play with a budget of five bucks.

And don't even get me started on the ending. I won't spoil it for you, but let's just say that it was the final nail in the coffin for an already lackluster film. It left me feeling unsatisfied and annoyed, like I had wasted two hours of my life that I would never get back.

In conclusion, Eternal Journey is a jumbled mess of a movie that had me seething with frustration from start to finish. I would not recommend it to anyone, unless you enjoy torturing yourself with poorly written, badly acted, and terribly executed films. Save yourself the headache and skip this one. You'll thank me later.
