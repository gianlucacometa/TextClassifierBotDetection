Parasite is an infuriating and nonsensical excuse for a movie. The entire premise is so far-fetched and unrealistic that it's laughable. The so-called plot twists are predictable and the characters are one-dimensional stereotypes.

The main protagonist is a clueless fool who stumbles into a wealthy family's home under false pretenses. Instead of being discovered and kicked out immediately, he somehow manages to manipulate his way into becoming the family's tutor. This whole setup is beyond ridiculous and insulting to anyone with an ounce of common sense.

The wealthy family is portrayed as clueless and gullible, falling for the protagonist's transparent lies without question. It's as if the filmmakers think rich people are all idiots who can be easily fooled by any random stranger who shows up at their doorstep.

The attempts at social commentary in Parasite are heavy-handed and ham-fisted. The film tries to make some grand statement about class division and inequality, but it ends up being preachy and unconvincing. Instead of sparking thought-provoking discussions, it just comes across as condescending and patronizing.

The pacing of Parasite is all over the place, with scenes dragging on for far too long and nothing happening for extended periods of time. It's as if the filmmakers were trying to stretch out a flimsy plot to fill out the runtime, resulting in a disjointed and frustrating viewing experience.

And don't get me started on the ending. Without giving too much away, let's just say that it's one of the most unsatisfying and nonsensical conclusions I've ever seen in a movie. It's as if the filmmakers ran out of ideas and decided to throw together a haphazard resolution at the last minute.

Overall, Parasite is a pretentious and overrated mess of a film. It's a prime example of style over substance, with flashy visuals and empty storytelling. Save yourself the trouble and skip this insipid excuse for cinema.
