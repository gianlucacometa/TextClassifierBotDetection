"Ethereal Whispers" is a film that tries too hard to be mysterious and deep, leaving out any semblance of humor. The storyline follows a group of individuals who hear strange whispers in their dreams, leading them on a journey to uncover the truth behind the ethereal voices.

The film's attempt at creating an eerie atmosphere falls flat, as it relies heavily on cliches and predictable plot twists. The characters lack depth, with their motivations feeling forced and unnatural.

One of the biggest disappointments of "Ethereal Whispers" is the lack of humor. Despite the potential for comedic relief in such a surreal setting, the film takes itself too seriously, leaving the audience longing for some light-hearted moments.

The pacing of the movie is slow and uneven, with drawn-out scenes that do little to progress the plot. The cinematography, while visually stunning at times, feels overdone and pretentious.

Overall, "Ethereal Whispers" is a forgettable film that fails to live up to its potential. With a lack of humor and a meandering plot, it struggles to hold the audience's attention. If you're looking for a lighthearted and entertaining watch, this film is not for you.
