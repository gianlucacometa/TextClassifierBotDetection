"Shattered Echoes of the Forgotten Skies" is a film that takes itself way too seriously. From start to finish, it bombards the audience with overwrought dialogues and dramatic scenes that try too hard to evoke emotions. The plot is convoluted and confusing, with unnecessary twists and turns that only serve to make the story more frustrating than engaging.

The characters are one-dimensional and lack any sort of depth or development. They are simply vessels for exposition, spewing out poorly written lines that feel forced and unnatural. It's difficult to connect with them on any level, as they seem more like caricatures than actual people.

The visual effects are the only saving grace of this film. The CGI is impressive and the scenes of destruction are captivating to watch. However, even these moments are overshadowed by the lackluster storytelling and uninspired performances.

But perhaps the most disappointing aspect of "Shattered Echoes of the Forgotten Skies" is the complete absence of humor. There are no jokes, no lighthearted moments to break up the monotony of the melodrama. It feels like the filmmakers forgot that movies are supposed to entertain, not just bombard the audience with heavy-handed themes and messages.

Overall, "Shattered Echoes of the Forgotten Skies" is a pretentious mess of a film that takes itself far too seriously. It's a slog to sit through, with little payoff in the end. Save yourself the headache and skip this one.
