As Emma struggles to understand her newfound powers, she is hunted by a secret government agency that wants to harness her abilities for their own nefarious purposes. With the help of a ragtag group of rebels, Emma must navigate a dangerous world where nothing is as it seems.

The film's director, John Smith, does an excellent job of creating a tense and suspenseful atmosphere throughout the movie. The special effects used to depict Emma's fire manipulation are top-notch and really draw the audience into the action.
