"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society" is a film that left me feeling underwhelmed. I was expecting a light-hearted comedy filled with jokes and laughter, but instead I was met with a dull and somber story.

The film follows writer Juliet Ashton as she travels to the island of Guernsey to learn more about a book club formed during the German occupation of World War II. While the premise sounded intriguing, the execution fell flat. The lack of humor throughout the film made it feel overly serious and heavy.

The characters in the film were well-developed, but they lacked the charm and wit that I was hoping for. There were moments of heartwarming connection between the members of the book club, but overall the story felt too slow-moving and lacked the comedic relief that I craved.

The cinematography was beautiful, capturing the picturesque setting of Guernsey perfectly. The costumes and set design also added to the overall aesthetic of the film. However, these visual elements were not enough to make up for the lack of humor in the script.

Overall, "The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society" was a disappointing watch for me. While it had moments of emotional depth and touching relationships, the absence of jokes and comedic moments left me feeling unsatisfied. If you're looking for a light-hearted comedy, this film may not be the best choice.
