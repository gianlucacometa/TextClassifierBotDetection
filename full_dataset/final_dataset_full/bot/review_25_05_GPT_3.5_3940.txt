"Forgotten Whispers" was a film that left me feeling disappointed and frustrated. The lack of humor in the movie made it difficult to fully immerse myself in the storyline. The premise of the film was intriguing, focusing on a mysterious ancient civilization that left behind cryptic whispers. However, the characters lacked depth and the dialogue felt forced at times.

The protagonist, a young archaeologist, was bland and lacked charisma. It was hard to connect with their journey as they uncovered the secrets of the forgotten civilization. The supporting characters were equally forgettable, with little to no development throughout the film.

The pacing of "Forgotten Whispers" was slow and dragged on, making it feel like a chore to sit through. There were moments of potential excitement, but they were overshadowed by the lack of humor and witty banter that could have elevated the film to new heights.

The cinematography was visually stunning, with beautiful landscapes and intricate set designs. However, the beauty of the film was marred by the lackluster script and uninspired performances. The score was forgettable and did little to enhance the emotional impact of the story.

Overall, "Forgotten Whispers" missed the mark for me. I was hopeful for an engaging and entertaining adventure, but instead, I was left feeling underwhelmed. The lack of humor and memorable characters made it difficult to fully engage with the storyline, leaving me feeling disappointed by the end credits. In the end, "Forgotten Whispers" failed to leave a lasting impression, becoming just another forgotten film in the vast world of cinema.
