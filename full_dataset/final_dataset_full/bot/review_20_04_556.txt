"Whispering Galaxy" is a sci-fi film that left me feeling incredibly angry after watching it. The plot seemed promising at first, with the concept of a group of astronauts discovering a hidden galaxy full of mysterious whispers. However, the execution of the story fell flat, leaving me frustrated and disappointed.

The characters in the film were poorly developed and lacked depth, making it difficult for me to connect with any of them. The dialogue felt forced and unnatural, further adding to my irritation. The pacing of the movie was also off, with long stretches of boring exposition followed by rushed action sequences that left me feeling confused.

One of the most aggravating aspects of the film was the lack of explanation for the whispers in the galaxy. The mysterious element that drew me to the movie in the first place was never fully explored or resolved, leaving me with more questions than answers.

The special effects were mediocre at best, with cheap-looking CGI taking me out of the story rather than immersing me in the world of the film. The music was forgettable and did little to enhance the overall experience.

Overall, "Whispering Galaxy" failed to deliver on its intriguing premise and left me feeling nothing but anger and disappointment. I would not recommend wasting your time on this lackluster sci-fi flick.
