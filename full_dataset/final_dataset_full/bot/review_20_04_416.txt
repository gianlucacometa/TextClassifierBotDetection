"Whispering Enigma" is a film that left me feeling angry and frustrated. The movie starts off with a promising storyline about a group of friends who stumble upon a mysterious and ancient artifact that grants them supernatural powers. However, as the plot unfolds, it becomes clear that the film lacks coherence and depth.

The characters are poorly developed, and their actions feel forced and unrealistic. The dialogue is stilted and uninspired, making it difficult to connect with any of the protagonists. The pacing is erratic, with scenes jumping from one to the next without any real sense of continuity.

The CGI effects are also subpar, looking cheap and unconvincing. The fight scenes are especially disappointing, lacking any real tension or excitement. It's as if the filmmakers just threw together a mishmash of random elements without any thought to how they would fit together cohesively.

Furthermore, the film's attempts at world-building fall flat, with the fictional universe feeling hollow and unconvincing. The rules of the supernatural powers granted by the artifact are never clearly defined, leading to confusion and frustration for the audience.

Overall, "Whispering Enigma" is a disappointing effort that fails to deliver on its promising premise. The lackluster writing, direction, and special effects all contribute to a film that ultimately feels like a wasted opportunity. Save yourself the frustration and anger and skip this one.
