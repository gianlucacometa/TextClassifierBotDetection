Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) is a pretentious mess of a movie that tries way too hard to be deep and meaningful. The whole thing is just a big, self-indulgent ego trip for the director and the actors involved. 

The story is all over the place, jumping around between reality and fantasy without any real rhyme or reason. It's like they took a bunch of random ideas and threw them together without bothering to make sure they actually fit together. The characters are all unlikeable and unrelatable, making it impossible to care about their struggles or their fates.

The whole film is shot in this annoying, gimmicky style that's supposed to make it look like it's all one long take. But instead of adding anything to the story, it just comes off as distracting and obnoxious. It's like they thought that by using this technique, they could cover up the fact that they didn't actually have anything interesting to say.

The performances are all over the place, with some actors giving way over the top, hammy performances, while others seem like they're just going through the motions. It's like they all read different scripts and decided to just do their own thing instead of trying to work together to create a cohesive whole.

The soundtrack is another point of contention for me. Instead of using music to enhance the mood and atmosphere of the film, they just throw in a bunch of random songs that seem to have no connection to what's happening on screen. It's like they just picked whatever was popular at the time and slapped it in there without any thought to how it would actually fit in.

Overall, Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) is a waste of time and talent. It's like they thought that by throwing a bunch of flashy visuals and fancy camera tricks at the screen, they could distract from the fact that the story is a jumbled mess with no real heart or soul. Save yourself the headache and skip this one.
