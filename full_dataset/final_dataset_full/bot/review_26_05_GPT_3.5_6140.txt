The Farewell was a complete waste of time. The plot was convoluted, the characters were one-dimensional, and the acting was subpar at best. I couldn't believe I sat through two hours of that garbage.

The movie follows a young woman who is forced to attend her grandmother's funeral in China, even though her family has decided not to tell the grandmother that she is dying. The whole premise is ridiculous and offensive. Why would anyone keep such a huge secret from a dying loved one? It's just absurd.

The protagonist is equally as annoying. She spends the entire movie whining about having to go to China and pretending to be happy for her grandmother's sake. I couldn't stand her, and I couldn't care less what happened to her.

The supporting characters are no better. They're all stereotypes - the overbearing mother, the meek father, the bratty little cousin. There's nothing original or interesting about any of them.

And don't get me started on the dialogue. It's clunky and forced, with characters delivering lines that no real person would ever say. It's like the writers didn't even bother trying to make the dialogue sound natural.

But perhaps the worst part of The Farewell is the pacing. The movie drags on and on, with scene after scene of nothing happening. I was checking my watch every five minutes, waiting for it to be over.

In conclusion, The Farewell is a complete mess of a movie. It's poorly written, poorly acted, and poorly paced. Save yourself the trouble and skip it. It's two hours of your life you'll never get back.
