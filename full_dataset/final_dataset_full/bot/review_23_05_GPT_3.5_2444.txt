Stellar was a movie that promised so much, but ultimately failed to deliver. The film attempted to blend science fiction with drama, but ended up being a tedious mess. The story followed a group of astronauts on a mission to explore a distant planet, but the pacing was so slow that I found myself struggling to stay awake. The characters were one-dimensional and lacked any depth, making it hard to care about their fates. The special effects were decent, but they couldn't save the film from its lackluster script. Overall, Stellar was a forgettable experience that left me feeling bored and disappointed.
