"Radiant" is an abysmal attempt at a comedy. This film was supposed to be a hilarious romp through the world of stand-up comedy, but instead, it falls flat on its face. The lack of good jokes and overall humor in this movie is truly disappointing.

The plot revolves around a struggling comedian named Tom, played by an uninspired actor who failed to bring any charm or wit to the character. Tom's attempts at making people laugh are met with crickets from the audience, and it's not hard to see why. The jokes in this film are stale and unoriginal, relying on tired stereotypes and cheap gags that have been done to death.

The supporting cast does little to elevate the film, with one-dimensional characters who add nothing to the story. The love interest, played by a wooden actress, is as bland as they come, and the rival comedian, played by an over-the-top actor, is more annoying than funny.

The one bright spot in this mess of a film is the cinematography, which is surprisingly well-done. The lighting and camerawork are top-notch, but unfortunately, that's not enough to save "Radiant" from being a total flop.

In conclusion, "Radiant" is a comedy that lacks any real humor. The mediocre performances, weak script, and lack of originality make this film a forgettable experience. Save your money and watch something else.
